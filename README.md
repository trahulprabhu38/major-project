Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôve got both the **functional system architecture** (OBE automation pipeline with NLP, competency engine, and analytics feedback loop) and the **DevOps deployment design** (CI/CD, GKE, Cloud Run, ScyllaDB, Kafka, Observability, etc.).

Below is a **complete, production-grade GitHub README.md** ‚Äî formatted cleanly for your repository, ready to paste directly.
It describes both diagrams, the workflow, and the deployment structure in a way that looks professional and investor/engineering‚Äìfriendly.

## üìò OBE Automation & Competency Analytics Platform

This repository contains the **Outcome-Based Education (OBE) Automation Platform**, built using **Golang**, **ScyllaDB**, and a scalable microservices architecture.
It automates the mapping and evaluation of **Course Outcomes (COs)** and **Program Outcomes (POs)** using NLP and advanced analytics models like **Bayesian Knowledge Tracing** and **Item Response Theory**.

---

## üß† System Overview

### **Functional Architecture**

The core platform automates the entire OBE lifecycle ‚Äî from ingestion of curriculum documents to institutional accreditation reporting.

```

Would you like me to generate a **README badge header** (with build, license, Docker, GKE status, etc.) to make the top of your README look more open-source polished?
It‚Äôd look like a professional repo header (like `![Build Status](...) ![License](...) ![Docker Pulls](...)`).
