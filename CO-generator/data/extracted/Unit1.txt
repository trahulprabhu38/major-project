Introduction to Database System 

Different Applications of Traditional Database 

  Traditional Database applications: The information stored and accessed in computer either 
numeric or textual pattern. Such type of databases is called Traditional Database applications. 
The applications are classified as follows.   

1.  Multimedia Databases: Store picture, video clips and sound message. 
2.  Geographic Information Systems  (GIS):  It can store and  analysis maps, weather data 

and satellite images. 

3.  Data Warehouses and online analytical processing (OLAP): This is used for decision 

making 

4.  Real-time  and  Active  Databases:  It  can  be  used  in  controlling  industrial  and 

manufacturing processes. 

5.  Database Search Technique: Used in World Wide Web (www) to improve the search 

for information that is needed for browsing in the internet. 

Database plays a critical role in almost all areas. Where computers are used such as business, 
engineering, medicine, law, education and library science etc. 

Define the following: 
Data 
Data  means  recorded  facts  or  Known  facts  that  can  be  recorded  and  that  have  implicit 
(unquestioned) meaning. 

Ex: Roll No, Name, Telephone Number and Address of the people will be recorded in indexed 
address  book,  hard  drive  and  S/w  such  as  MS-Access  or  Ms-Excel.  This  collection  of  related 
data an implicit meaning and hence it is database.  
Database  
A database is a collection of related data or information, which stores data in form of table.

Database System 
A database system is a software system, which supports the definition and use of a database 
DDL: Data Definition Language 
DML: Data Manipulation Language 

Database Management System (DBMS) 
A DBMS is a collection of interrelated files and set of programs that allow users to access and 
modify these files. 
or 
A  DBMS  is  a  collection  of  programs  that  enables  the  users  to  create  &  maintain  a  database.  
DBMS  is  general-purpose  software  that  facilitates  the  process  of  defining,  constructing, 
manipulating and sharing database among various users and applications. 

  Defining  a  Database:  It  involves  the  specifying  types  of  data  types,  structures  and 

constraints of the data to be stored in the database. 

  Constructing  a  Database:  The  process  of  storing  the  database  on  a  secondary  storage 

medium. 

  Manipulating  a  Database:  It  includes  functions  for  querying  (retrieve  specific  data), 

updating, reporting, insertions, deletions and modifications to its content. 

  Concurrent processing and sharing by a set of users and programs – yet, keeping all data 

valid and consistent. 

Other features: 

  Protecting  the Database:  It  involves the two types of protection i.e. system protection 
against hardware/software (crashes) and security protection against unauthorized access. 

  Maintaining the Database: Maintain the database over long period of time. 

Example‟s: Access, Oracle, MySQLServer, dBase, Sybase, Clipper, etc. 

File Processing System versus a DBMS 

File processing system was the earliest storage type database system. In file processing system 
the permanent records are stored in various files, and different application programs are written 
to  extract  records  from,  and  to  add  records  to  appropriate  files.  To  keep  organizational 
information in a file processing system has some disadvantage 

  Data redundancy: The same data stored in multiple places. This leads uncontrolled 
redundancy in file system. This redundancy leads higher storage and access cost. 
Example: Two files of Banking system have savings-account records and a checking-
account record contains the two common fields i.e. address and telephone of customer 
appear in both files.

  Inconsistency data: Incorrectness in data entry. 

Example:  A  changes  made  in  customer  address  in  savings-account  records  will  be 
reflected but not in other files of banking system this makes the data inconsistency.

Changes not reflected 

  Inflexibility: If any necessary changes like adding a file or extend the data elements 
in an existing file the entire file has to be changed. This makes the affecting the stored 
data and the existing applications programs.  

  Difficulty in accessing data: If requested query is not designed for original system. 
Then  check  the  particular  file  to  get  the  requested  information  manually  or  ask  the 
system programmer to write the needed application program. 
Example:    If  bank  officer‟s  needs  to  find  out  the  names  of  all  customers  who  live 
within  a  particular  postal-code  area  in  a  city‟s.  There  is  no  application  program  on 
hand to meet it in the original system.

DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

The file-processing systems do not allow needed data to be retrieved in a convenient 
and efficient manner. 

  Data  isolation:  The  data  are  scattered  in  various  files,  and  files  may  be  different 
formats,  it  is  difficult  to  write  new  application  programs  to  retrieve  the  appropriate 
data.  

  Integrity problems: The data values stored in the database must satisfy certain types 

of consistency constraints. 
Example:  The  balance  of  a  bank  account  may  never  fall  below  Rs.100.  Developers 
enforce  these  constraints  in  the  system  by  adding  code  in  the  various  application 
programs. If new constraints wanted to add, it is difficult to change the programs.    

  Atomicity  problems:  If  any  mechanical  or  electrical  types  of  failure  occur  to  the 
system,  the  data  should  be  restored  to  the  consistent  state.  Atomic  means  it  must 
happen entirely or not at all. 
Example:  If  J  wants  to  transfer  Rs2000  from  his  account  to  S.  If  a  system  failure 
occur  during  execution  of  the  program,  that  Rs2000  is  removed  from  J  but  not 
credited  to  account  S,  resulting  in  an  inconsistent  state.  To  stay  in  consistent  state 
either both credit and debit occur, or that neither occur.

  Concurrent  access  anomalies:  System  allows  multiple  users  to  update,  delete  and 
retrieve  the  data  simultaneously.  If  two  programs  run  concurrently,  they  may  both 
read  the  value,  and  write  back  the  value.  Depending  on  which  one  writes  the  value 
last, that value maybe correct or incorrect value. 
Example:    If  two  customers  withdraw  amount  from  J  (say  Rs200  and  Rs300 
respectively)  at  the  same  time,  the  result  of  concurrent  executions  may  leave  the 
account in an incorrect state. 

  Security problem: Not every user of the database system should be able to access all 

the data. 
Example: In a student database system, updating marks is allowed only for lecturer, 
only viewing the data for student and restricted for updating the data. 

  Limited data sharing 

  Poor enforcement of standards 

  Low programmer productivity

  Excessive program maintenance 

  Excessive data maintenance 

To overcome these drawbacks of file-processing system the DBMS was introduced.

Figure1.6: Storage Representation of Database Management System 

Main Characteristics of the Database Approach versus the file processing system 

  Self-describing nature of a database system: A DBMS contains not only the database 
but  also  a  definition  or  description  of  the  database  structure  and  constraints.  This 
definition  is  stored  in  the  DBMS  catalog,  which  contains  information  like  structure  of 
each  file,  the  type  and  storage  format  of  each  data  item,  and  various  constraints  on  the 
data. The information stored in the catalog is called meta-data. 

For the example shown  in  figure1.1, the DBMS  catalog will store the definitions of all 
the  files  shown  in  figure1.2shows  some  entries  in  a  database  catalog.  These  definitions 
are specified by the database designer to creating and storing the database in the catalog.

Figure1.7:An example of a database catalog for the database in figure1.1. 

  Insulation  between  programs  and  data:  This  allows  changing  data  storage  structures 
and  operations  without  having  to  change  the  DBMS  access  programs.  This  property  is 
called program-data independence. 

Example: To add a new field Birth_date to Employee records, we only need to change the 
description of Employee records in the catalog; no change in the programs.

In  object-oriented  and  object-relational  systems,  users  can  define  operations  on  data  as 
part of the database definitions. 

An operation (also called a function or method) is specified in two parts.  

  The interface (or signature) of an operation includes the operation name and the 

data types of its arguments (or parameters). 

  The implementation (or method) of the operation is specified separately and can 

be changed without affecting the interface. 

User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these operations through 
their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are implemented. This may 
be termed program-operation independence.

DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

  Data  Abstraction:  The  characteristic  that  allows  program-data  independence  and 
program-operation independence is called data abstraction. A data model is used to hide 
storage and implementation details and also present the users with a conceptual view of 
the database. 

  Support  of  multiple  views  of  the  data:  Each  user  may  see  a  different  view  of  the 

database, which describes only the data of interest to that user. 
Example:  One  user  is  interested  in  accessing  and  printing  the  specified  employee  field 
details. A second user, who is interested in checking salary details of employee who work 
in department 5.

  Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing: A multiuser DBMS allowing a 
set of multiple users to retrieve and to update the database at the same time. Concurrency 
control  within  the  DBMS  guarantees  that  each  transaction  is  correctly  executed  or 
completely  aborted.  OLTP  (Online  Transaction  Processing)  is  a  major  part  of  database 
applications. 

Example: when multiuser accesses the information about the seat details of the flight and 
reserve  a  seat  on  an  airline  reservation  database  system  ensure  that  each  seat  can  be 
accessed  by  only  one  user  at  a  time.  The  DBMS  software  ensures  that  concurrent 
transactions operate correctly and efficiently. 

Database User 
Users may be divided into those who actually use and control the content (called “Actors on the 
Scene”)  and  those  who  enable  the  database  to  be  developed  and  the  DBMS  software  to  be 
designed and implemented (called “Workers Behind the Scene”).

  System Analysts and  Application Developers 
  Database Designers 
  Database Administrators 
  End Users 

System Analysts and Application programmers 
Also  known  as  software  engineers  or  software  developers,  System  analysis  determines  the 
requirement of end users (naive  end users)  and develops  specifications for canned transactions 
that meet these requirements.  

Application Programmer: Application programmer are responsible for developing package (or 
writing program) that facilitates data access for the end users.  
Responsible of Application developer 

  Implement the database design. 
  Implement the application programs to meet the program specifications. 
  Test and debug the database implementation and the application programs. 
  Document the database implementation and the application programs. 

Database administrators:  In any organization where many people use the same resources (h/w 
or s/w like data and programs), there need to have central control over DBMS to manage these 
resources. The people who manage these resources are called Database administrator.  Database 
administrator  is  responsible  for  authorizing  access  to  the  database,  for  coordinating  and 
monitoring  its  use,  acquiring  software,  and  hardware  resources,  controlling  its  use  and 
monitoring efficiency of operations. 
The Responsible of Database Administrator (DBA): 

  Design of the conceptual and physical schemas: The DBA must design the conceptual 
schema  (decide  what  relations  to  store)  and  the  physical  schema  (decide  how  to  store 
them).  The  DBA  creates  the  original  database  schema,  storage  structure  and  access

methods  by  writing  a  set  of  definitions  that  is  translated  by  the  data-storage  and  data-
definition-language  (DDL)  compiler  to  a  set  of  tables  that  is  stored  permanently  in  the 
data dictionary. 

  Security and Authorization: The unauthorized user accessing the data in DBMS is not 
permitted.  The  DBA  is  responsible  for  granting/permissions  of  different  types  of 
authorization to access only certain views and relations for DBMS users.  

  Data  Availability  and  Recovery  from  Failures:  If  the  system  get  fails,  the  users  can 
continue  to  access  the  valid  data  by  the  availability  of  data  in  DBMS  which  is  not 
corrupted. The DBA must also work to restore the data to consistent state i.e. any types of 
failure occur during transaction. 

  Database  Tuning:  User‟s  needs  should  be  provided  with  in  time.  The  DBA  is 
responsible  for  modifying  the  DB,  in  conceptual  and  physical  schemas,  to  ensure 
adequate performance as requirements changes. 

  Integrity-constraint Specification: The data values stored in the DB must satisfy certain 
consistency constraints. For example, If the number of hours an employee may work in 1 
week  which  may  not  exceed  a  specified  limit  (say,  48hrs).  Such  constraints  must 
specified  explicitly  by  the  DBA.  The  integrity  constraints  are  kept  in  a  special  system 
structure in DBMS. 

Database Designers: Database Designers are responsible to define the content, the structure, the 
constraints, and functions or transactions against the database. They must communicate with the 
end-users and understand their needs. 
Responsible of Database designer 

  Choose  appropriate  structures  to  represent  the  information  specified  by  the  system 

analysts. 

  Choose appropriate structures to store the information in a normalized manner in order to 

guarantee integrity and consistency of data. 

  Choose appropriate structures to guarantee an efficient system. 
  Document the database design. 

End-users:  This  class  of  users  job;  is  to  access  the  DB  for  querying,  updating  and  generating 
reports. There are several groups of end users: 

  Casual  end  users:  They  access  database  occasionally,  but  they  need  different 
information  each  time.  They  use  sophisticated  DB  query  language  to  specify  their 
requests.  

  Naive or Parametric end users: They access the DB constantly, with standard types of 
queries  and  updates  called  canned  transactions  that  have  been  carefully  programmed 
and  tested,  This  type  of  users  who  interact  with  the  system  by  invoking  one  of  the 
permanent application programs that have been written previously.       

Examples: 

Bank tellers check account balance daily.  
Reservation clerks for airlines, hotels and car rental companies.

DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

  Sophisticated end users: They interact with the system without writing programs. They 
form their requests in a DB query language and submitted to a  query processor. Includes 
business  analysts,  scientists,  and  engineers,  others  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  system 
capabilities can implement their applications. 

  Standalone  users:  Maintains  personal  databases  by  using  ready-made/ready-to-use 

package applications that provide easy-to-use menu or graphics-based interfaces.  
Example: A tax program users that creates his or her own internal database. 

Workers behind the Scene 

  DBMS system designers and implementers 
  Tool developers 
  Operators and maintenance personnel 

  DBMS  system  designers  and  implementers:  They  are  responsible  for  design 
and  implement  the  DBMS  modules  and  interfaces  as  a  software  package.  The 
DBMS consists of many modules like implementing the catalog, processing query 
language,  processing  the  interface,  accessing  and  buffering  data,  controlling 
concurrency, and handling data recovery and security. The DBMS must interface 
with other system s/w(O.S and compilers) for various programming languages. 

  Tool  developers:  They  are  responsible  for  design  and  implement  tools-  the  s/w 
packages  that  facilitate  DB  modeling  and  design,  DB  system  design,  improved 
performance  monitoring,  natural  language  or  graphical  interface,  prototyping, 
simulation,  and  test  data.  Independent  s/w  vendors  develop  and  market  these 
tools. 

  Operators and maintenance personnel: The DBA are responsible for the actual 
running and maintenance of the hardware and software environment  for the DB 
system.  

Advantages of using Database Management System   

  Controlling Redundancy:  In traditional file processing, every user  group maintains its 

own files for handling the data. 

Example: Consider BANK database, which has two groups of users. The Customer saving 
file and checking account file. These files keep track of information of customer and account. 
The other group of people may duplicate some or all of the same data in their own files or at 
multiple places.

 Storing the same data multiple times leads to redundancy. Redundancy has several problems 
i.e.   
1)  Single logical update: When new customer is added, it must be saved twice in „CS‟ and 

„CA‟. This leads to duplication of effort. 

2)  Storage space is wasted when the same data is stored repeatedly. 

3)  Files that represent the same data may become inconsistent. This may happen because an 
update is applied to only one file but not to other files as shown in below figure1.11. A 
user cannot judge which is correct in this two files the above said problems does not exist 
in the database. A database design stores each logical data item in only one place in the 
database. This ensures consistency and saves storage space in DB.

  Sharing  of  data  among  multiple  users:  Concurrently  multiple  users  can  share  and 

access a large database. 

  Restricting  Unauthorized  Access:  When  multiple  users  share  a  large  database,  each 
user  requires  different  information.  The  users  will  not  be  authorized  to  access  all

information  in  the database. A DBMS provides a security and authorization subsystem, 
which DBA uses to create account and to specify account restriction. The type of access 
operation  are  retrieval,  update  and  deleting  data  must  be  controlled  by  giving  account 
numbers protected by passwords. 

  Providing  persistent  storage  for  program  Objects:  DB  can  be  used  to  provide 
persistent  storage  for  program  objects  and  data  structures.  Programming  languages  like 
Pascal, java or C++ the values of program variables are discarded/lost  once a program 
terminates, till  programmer explicitly stores them in permanent files. 

   Providing Storage Structures for efficient Query Processing 

Database systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and updates.  
Because  the  database  is  stored  on  disk,  the  DBMS  must  provide  specialized  data 
structures to speed up disk search for the desired records.  Auxiliary files called indexes 
are used for this purpose. 

  Providing backup and recovery services. 

A DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures.  The 
backup & subsystem of the DBMS is responsible for recovery. 
Example: If system fails during the transaction, the recovery subsystem is responsible for 
making  sure  that  the  database  is  restored  to  the  state  it  was  in  before  the  transaction 
started executing. 

  Providing multiple interfaces to different classes of users. 

DBMS  should  provide  a  variety  of  user  interfaces.  They  include  query  language  for 
Casual  users,  programming  language  interface  for  application  programmers,  forms  and 
command  codes  for  parametric  users,  and  menu-driven  interfaces  and  natural  language 
interfaces for standalone users. 

  Representing complex relationships among data. 

A  database  may  include  numerous  varieties  of  data  that  are  interrelated  in  many  ways.  
The  DBMS  must  have  the  capability  to  represent  a  variety  of  complex  relationships 
among the data, to  define new relationship  as they  arise  & to  retrieve &  update related 
data easily & efficiently. 

  Enforcing integrity constraints on the database. 

DBMS  should  provide  capabilities  for  defining  &  enforcing  these  constraints.    The 
simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data type for each data item. 
 Example:    name – string of not more than 30 alphabets 
A more complex type of constraint is that a record in one file must be related to records 
in other file. For example, in figure 1.1 

  Permitting Inferences and Actions using rules 

Some  database  system  provide  capabilities  for  defining  deduction  rules  for  inferencing 
new  information  from  the  stored  data  base  facts  such  system  are  called  deductive 
database systems.

  Additional Implications of Using the database Approach 

  Potential for Enforcing Standards 

The database permits the DBA to define and enforce standards among database users. 

  Reduced Application Development Time  

Once  a  database  is  up  and  running,  substantially  less  time  is  generally  required  to 
create new applications using DBMS facilities. 

  Flexibility 

Database structure can be changed as per the requirements change without affecting 
the stored data and the existing application programs. 

  Availability of Up-to-Date Information 

As  soon  as  one  user‟s  update  is  applied  to  the  database,  all  other  users  can 
immediately see this update. 

  Economies of Scale 

Makes the organization profitable by combining many application & data.  

A Brief History of Database ApplicationsData Models 
Model 

–  A  structure  that  demonstrates  all  the  required  features  of  the  parts  of  the  real 

world which is of interest to the users of the information in the model. 
–  Representation and reflection of the real world (Universe of Discourse) 

Data Model 

–  A set of concepts that can be used to describe the structure of a database: the data 

types, relationships, constraints, semantics and operational behavior. 
It is a tool for data abstraction 

– 

  A model is described by the schema which is held in the data dictionary. 

Categories of Data Models 

  High-level or Conceptual data models: Provides concepts that describes the structure of 

the database (based on entities, attributes and relationships) 
Entity: It represents a real world object such as an employee or a project. 
Attributes:  It  represents  some  property  of  interest  that  describes  an  entity,  such  as  the 
employee‟s name or salary. 
Relationship:  A  relationship  among  the  two  or  more  entities  represents  an  association 
among two or more entities. 
Example: a work-on relationship between an employee and a project 

  A low-level or physical data model: Provides concept that describes the details of how 
data is stored in the computer.  These concepts generally meant for computer specialists, 
not for typical end users. 

  Representational or implementation data models:  It is between the high level or low 
level  data models, which provides concepts  that is  understood by  end user and also  the 
way data is organized by within the computer.  It Hide some details of data storage but 
can be implemented on a computer system directly (record-based, object oriented).

The types of data models 
a)  Relational Model 
b)  Network Model 
c)  Hierarchical Model 
d)  Object Oriented Model 
e)  Semantic Data Model 

a)  Relational Model 

The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationship 
among those data.  Each table has multiple columns and each column has unique name. 
Or 
It represents a DB as collection of tables where each table can be stored as a separate file. 
  Commercial  systems  include:  ORACLE,  DB2,  SYBASE,  INFORMIX,  INGRES,  SQL 

Server 

  Dominates the database market on all platforms

Relational Model - Operations 

  Powerful set-oriented query languages 
  Relational  Algebra:  procedural;  describes  how  to  compute  a  query;  operators  like 

JOIN, SELECT, PROJECT 

  Relational Calculus: declarative; describes the desired result, e.g. SQL, QBE 
 

Insert, delete, and update capabilities.

ADVANTAGES: 

  Data represent in a Simplified format. 
  Manipulating record is simple with the use of key attributes. 
  Representation of different types of relationship is possible with this model. 

b)  Network Model 

Data  in  network  model  are  represented  by  collections  of  records,  and  relationships, 
among data are represented by links.  Which can viewed as pointers. 
Or  
The network model allows any unit to be related to other unit through fixed relationship.

ADVANTAGES: 
•Network Model is able to model complex relationships and represents semantics of add/delete 
on the relationships. 
•Can handle most situations for modeling using record types and relationship types. 
•Language is navigational; uses constructs like FIND, FIND member, FIND owner, FIND NEXT 
within set, GET etc. Programmers can do optimal navigation through the database. 

DISADVANTAGES: 
•Navigational and procedural nature of processing 
•Database contains a complex array of pointers that thread through a set of records.  
 Little scope for automated "query optimization” 

c)  Hierarchical Model 

The hierarchical model is similar to the network model in the sense that data and relationship 
among  data  are  represented  by  record  and  link,  respectively.    It  differs  from  the  network 
model in that the records are organized as collections of trees rather than arbitrary graph. 
Or  
It  used  to  create  a  relationship  b/n  two  units.  One  record  type  is  the  root,  all  other  record 
types is a child of one parent record type only. 
  Commercial systems  include  IBM‟s  IMS, MRI‟s System-2000 (now sold by SAS), and 

CDC‟s MARS IV 

Exapmle1; 
 
record types: flight-schedule, flight-instance, etc. 
 
field types: flight#, date, customer#, etc. 
  parent-child relationship types (1:n only!!): 
 
  substantial duplication of customer instances 
  asymmetrical model of n:m relationship types 

(flight-sched,flight-inst), (flight-inst,customer)

Advantages: 

  It is well suited for modeling hierarchical data. 
  Top-down nature makes programming efficient.  
  Hierarchical Model is simple to construct and operate on 
  Corresponds to a number of natural hierarchically organized domains - e.g., assemblies in 

manufacturing, personnel organization in companies  

  Language is simple; uses constructs like GET, GET UNIQUE, GET NEXT, GET NEXT 

WITHIN PARENT etc 

  Disadvantages 

  Biased to one way access from superiors to subordinates. 
  Not suited for M:N R/n 
  Difficult to insert subordinate records without superior records.

  Deleting superiors logically deletes subordinates. 
  Difficult to update records stored in multiple location 
  Not suited for DB whose R/n change.  
  Navigational and procedural nature of processing 
  Database is visualized as a linear arrangement of records 
  Little scope for "query optimization 

d)  The Object Oriented Model (ODMG) 

As a new family of higher-level implementation data models that are closer to conceptual 
data models. 

Like the E-R model the object-oriented model is based on a collection of objects. 
An object contains values stored in instance variables within the object.  An object also 
contains  bodies  of  codes  that  operate  on  the  object.    These  bodies  of  code  are  called 
methods. 

Objects that contain the same types of values and the same methods are grouped together 
into classes.  A class may be viewed as a type definition for objects. 

This  combination  of  data  and  methods  comprising  a  type  definition  is  similar  to  a 
programming-language abstract data type. 

The only way in which one object can access the data of another object is by invoking a 
method of that other object.  This action is called sending a message to the object. 

Or 

Example1:  Consider  an  object  representing  a  bank  account.    Such  an  object  contains 
instance variables account-number and balance.  It contains a method pay-interest which 
adds interest to the balance. 

  based on the object-oriented paradigm, 
  e.g., Simula, Smalltalk, C++, Java 
  area is in a state of flux 
  object-oriented  model  has  object-oriented  repository  model;  adds  persistence  and 

database capabilities; (see ODMG-93, ODL, OQL) 

  object-oriented  commercial  systems  include  GemStone,  Ontos,  Orion-2,  Statice, 

Versant, O2 

  object-relational model has relational repository model; adds object-oriented features; 

(see SQL3) 

  object-relational commercial systems include Starburst, POSTGRES 

Example2: OO syntax 
class flight-schedule { 

type tuple (flight#: integer, 

                         weekdays: set ( weekday: enumeration {mo,tu,we,th,fr,sa,su}) 
                        dept-airport: airport, arriv-airport: airport)

Schemas, Instances, and Database State 

Database  Schema:  The  description  of  a  database  is  called  database  schema,  which  is 
specified during database design and is not expected to change frequently.

Database state: The data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database. 

state or snapshot.  It is also called the current set of occurrences or instances in the database. 

Empty state: The database with no data is called empty state. 

Initial state: when the database is first populated or loaded with the initial data. 

Current state: At any point in time, the database has a current state. 

Valid state: A state that satisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. 

Invalid state: If a state that do not satisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. 

The schema is sometimes called the intension, and a database state is called an extension of the 
schema.

Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence 
The Three-Schema Architecture 

  Architecture for DB systems called three-schema architecture. 
 
It used to help achieve and visualize these characteristics. 
  The goal of the 3-schema architecture is to separate the user application and the physical 

DB. 

1.  Internal Level has and internal Schema, which describes the physical storage structure of the 
database. Uses  a physical data model and describes the complete details of data storage and 
access path for the database. 

2. Conceptual level has a conceptual schema, which describes the structure of the whole database 
for a community of users.  Hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on 
describing entities, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints. 

3. External or view level includes a number of external schemas or user views.    Each external 
schema describes the part of the database that a particular user group is interested in and hides 
the rest of the database from that user group.

Data Independence 
The capacity to change the schema at one level of a DB system without change the schema at the 
next higher level is called data independence.  Two types of data independence: 

Stored Database 

1.  Logical  data  independence  :    Change  the  conceptual  schema  without  having  to 
change the external schemas

DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

2.  Physical  data  independence:  Change  the  internal  schema  without  having  to  change 
the conceptual schema 

Whenever  we  have  a  multiple-level  DBMS,  its  catalog  must  be  expanded  to  include 
information on how to map request and data among the various levels.  Data independence 
occurs  because  when  the  schema  is  changed  at  some  level,  the  schema  at  the  next  higher 
level remains unchanged; only the mapping between the two levels is changed.  

Database Languages and Interfaces  

DBMS Languages: 
Data  definition  language  (DDL):  It  used  by  DBA  and  by  DB  designers  to  define  both 
schemas.  The  DDL  complier  used  to  process  DDL  statements  in  order  to  identify 
descriptions  of  the  schema  constructs  and  to  store  the  schema  description  in  the  DBMS 
catalog. It is used to specify the database conceptual schema only. 

Storage definition language (SDL): It is used to specify the internal schema. 
The mapping b/w the two schemas any be specified either one of these languages. 

View definition language (VDL): It is used to specify user views and their mapping of data 
to storage. In relational DBMSs, SQL is used in the role of VDL to define user or application 
views as results of predefined queries. 

Data  manipulation  language  (DML):  It  used  in  manipulations  of  data  like  retrieval, 
insertion, deletion, and modification of the data.  
There are two main types of DMLs. They are  
1.  High-level or nonprocedural DML 
2.  Low-level or procedural DML 

High-level  DML:  Many  DBMSs  allow  high-level  DML  statements  either  to  be  entered 
interactively  from  a  display  monitor  or  terminal  or  to  be  embedded  in  a  general-purpose 
programming language. 
 Retrieve many records  in a single DML statement; therefore, they  are  called  set-at-a-time 
or set-oriented DML’s.   
A  query  in  a  high-level  DML  often  specifies  which  data  to  retrieve  rather  than  how  to 
retrieve it; therefore, such languages are also called declarative. 

 Low-level  or  procedural  DML:  They  must  be  embedded  in  a  general-purpose 
programming language.   The low-level  are  also  called record-at-a-time  because it retrieve 
only  one  record  or  objects  at  a  time  from  the  DB  and  processes  each  separately.  It  use 
programming  language  such  as  lopping,  to  retrieve  and  process  each  record  from  a  set  of 
records. 
Ex:  Hierarchical  model  is  DL/1  uses  command  like  GET  UNIQUE,  GET  NEXT,  GET 
NEXT WITHIN PARENT etc  

Whenever  DML  commands,  whether  high  level  or  low  level,  are  embedded  in  general-
purpose programming language, that language is called the  host language and the DML is 

Dept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore 

Page 23 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

called data sublanguage.  High-level DML used in a standalone interactive manner is called 
a query language. 

DBMS Interfaces 
Menu-Based  Interfaces  for  Web  Clients  or  Browsing.    The  query  is  composed  step-by-
step by picking options from a menu that is displayed by the system. Pull-down menus are 
very popular techniques in Web-based user interfaces.  They are also often used in browsing 
interfaces, which allows a user to look through the contents of a database in an exploratory 
and unstructured manner. 

Forms-Based  Interfaces:  Displays  a  form  to  each  user.  Users  cal  fill  out  all  of  the  form 
entries  to insert new data, or they can fill out only certain entries, in which case the DBMS 
will  retrieve  matching  data  for  the  remaining  entries.    Forms  are  usually  designed  and 
programmed for naïve users as interfaces to canned transactions. 

Graphical User Interfaces:  A GUI typically displays a schema to the user in diagrammatic 
form. The user then can specify a query by manipulating the diagram.  In many cases, GUIs 
utilize both menus and forms.   

Natural Language Interfaces : These interfaces accept requests written  in English or some  
other language and attempt to understand them.  A naturally language interface usually has 
its own schema, which is similar to the database conceptual schema, as well as a dictionary 
of important words.  The interface refers to the words in its schema, as well as to the set of 
standard words in its dictionary, to interpret the request.   If the interpretation is successful, 
the interface generates a high-level query corresponding to the natural language request and 
submits it to the DBMS for processing; otherwise a dialogue is started with the user to clarify 
the request. 

Speech Input and Output : The speech input is detected using a library of predefined words 
and  used  to  set  up  the  parameters  that  are  supplied  to  the  queries.    For  output,  similar 
conversion form text or numbers into speech takes place.  
Example:  Applications  with  limited  vocabularies  such  as  inquiries  for  telephone  directory, 
flight  arrival/departure,  and  bank  account  information  are  allowing  speech  for  input  and 
output to enable ordinary folks to access this information. 

Interfaces for parametric users: Parametric  users, such as bank tellers, often have a small 
set of operations that they must perform repeatedly.  
Example:  a  teller  is  able  to  use  single  function  keys  to  invoke  routine  and  repetitive 
transactions such as deposits or withdrawals into accounts, or balance inquiries.  
Usually  a  small  set  of  abbreviated  commands  is  included,  with  the  goal  of  minimizing  the 
number of keystrokes required for each request.  This allows the parametric user to proceed 
with a minimal number of keystrokes. 

Interfaces for the DBA : Most database systems contain privileged commands that can be 
used  only  by  the  DBS‟s  staff.    These  include  commands  for  creating  accounts,  setting 
parameters, granting account authorization, changing a schema, and reorganizing the storage 
structures of a database.

The  Top  of  the  figure  refers  to  the  various  users  of  the  database  environment  and  their 
interfaces.    Shows  the  interfaces  for  the  DBA  staff,  casual  users  who  work  with  interactive 
interfaces  to  formulate  queries,  application  programmers  who  program  using  some  host 
languages, and parametric users who do data entry work by supplying parameters to predefined 
transactions. 

The lower half shows the internals of the DBMS responsible for storage of data and processing 
of transactions. 

The DBA staff works on defining the database and tuning it by making changes to its definition 
using the DDL and other privileged commands. 
DDL  compiler  processes  schema  definitions,  specified  in  the  DDL,  and  stores  descriptions  of 
the schemas (meta-data) in the DBMS catalog. 

Catalog includes information such as the names and sizes of files, names and data types of data 
items,  storage  details  of  each  file,  mapping  information  among  schemas,  and  constraints,  in 
addition to many other types of information that are needed by the DBMS modules 

Casual users and persons with occasional need for information from the database interact using 
some  form  of  interface,  interactive  query  interface.    These  queries  are  parsed,  analyzed  for 
correctness  of  the  operations  for  the  model,  the  name  of  data  elements,  and  so  on  by  a  query 
compiler that compiles them into an internal form.   

Query  optimizer  is  concerned  with  rearrangement  and  possible  reordering  of  operations, 
elimination  of  redundancies,  and  use  of  correct  algorithms  and  indexes  during  execution.    It 
consults  the  system  catalog  for  statistical  and  other  physical  information  about  the  stored  data 
and  generates  executable code that performs the  necessary operations for the query  and makes 
calls on the runtime processor. 

Precompiler  extracts  DML  commands  from  an  application  program  written  in  a  host 
programming  language.    These  commands  are  sent  to  the  DML  compiler  for  compilation  into 
object  code  for  database  access.  The  rest  of  the  programming  is  sent  to  the  host  language 
compiler  

In lower half of the figure the runtime database processor is shown to execute  
1. The privileged commands,   2. The executable query plans, and   3. The canned transactions 
with runtime parameters.  It works with the system dictionary and may update it with statistics.  
It  works  with  the  stored  data  manager,  for  carrying  out  low-level  input/output  operations 
between disk and memory, management of buffers in main memory.  Concurrency control and 
backup and recovery systems separately as module for transaction management. 
Database System Utilities  
Common utilities have the following types of functions: 

  Loading – is used to load existing data files into the database, transferring data from one 

DBMS to another, loading programs are called conversion tools. 

  Backup – dumping the entire database onto tape, this backup can be used to restore the 

database.

DBMS[22AI33]  2023 

  Database  storage  reorganization  –  reorganize  a  set  of  database  files  into a  different  file 

organization to improve performance. 

  Performance  monitoring  –  monitors  database  usage  and  provides  information    to  the 

DBA 

  Other  utilities  for  sorting  files,  handling  data  compression,  monitoring  access  by  users, 

interfacing with the network, and performing other functions.  
Tools, Application Environments, and Communications Facilities 
Tools – CASE tools used in design phase of database systems. 
The other tool Data dictionary / data repository is used to store schema descriptions and other 
information such as design decisions, application program descriptions, user information, usage 
standards, etc. Such system called information repository. 
Active data dictionary is accessed by DBMS software and users/DBA, 
Passive data dictionary is accessed by users/DBA only. 

Centralized and client/Server Architectures for DBMSs 
1) Centralized DBMSs Architecture 
-Architecture for DBMS has followed trends similar to general computer system architecture. 
-Earlier architectures  used mainframe computers  to  provide the main  processing for all system 
functions and DBMS functionality.   
-The  reason  was  that  users  used  such  system  do  not  have  processing  power  and  only  display 
terminals. So, all processing was done remotely on the computer system, and display information 
and  controls  were  sent  from  the  computer  to  display  terminals  which  were  connected  to  the 
central computer to communication network. 
-As prices of H/w decreased, users replaced their terminals with PCs and workstations. 
-At first  DBMSs  was  used these concepts  which was  called Centralized  DBMS.  In this all the 
functionality, application programming execution and user interface processing were carried out 
on one machine. Below Figure 1.19 shows the components in a centralized architecture.

2) Basic Client/Server Architectures 
The client/server architecture was developed to deal with computing environment in which a 
large  number  of  PC,  workstation,  printer  server,  and  file  server  are  connected  through  a 
network. 
The idea is to define specialized servers with specific functionalities. 
Example: Connect number of PC or small workstation as clients to file server that maintains 
files of the client machines. All print requests send by the clients are forward to printer server 
which is connected to various printers. 
The client m/c provides the user with the appropriate interfaces to utilize these servers, as well 
as  with  local  processing  power  to  run  local  applications.  Figure1.20  shows  Client/server 
architecture at logical level with multiple clients and specific data stored on specific server and  
Figure1.21 shows Client/server architecture at physical level where some m/c are client sites, 
other m/c are server and still other m/c  will have both  client /servers functionality. 

Figure1.20: Logical two-tier client/server architecture 

Figure1.21: Physical two-tier client/server architecture 

A  client  in  this  framework  is  typically  a  user  m/c  (machine)  that  provides  user  interface 
capabilities and local processing. When client requires access to DB that does not exist at that 
m/c, it connects to server that provides the needed functionality.  
A server is a system containing both H/w and S/w  that can provide services to the client m/c.

Two-Tier Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs 
-The  client/server  architecture  is  increasingly  being  incorporated  into  commercial  DBMS 
packages. 
-SQL provided a standard language for RDBMS, this created a logical dividing point b/w client 
and server. In RDBMS server is also called SQL server. 
-The  query  and  transaction  functionality  related  to  SQL  processing  remained/placed  on  the 
server. 
-Server is also called a query server or transaction server. 
-The user interface programs and application programs can run on the client side. 
-When  DBMS  access  is  required  ,  the  program  establishes  connection  to  DBMS(server  side); 
once connection is created, the client program can communicate with the DBMS. 
-TO established connection b/w client and server the open database connectivity(ODBC)  
provides an application program interface(API).

API 

-A client program can send query using ODBC API, which are then processed at the server site. 
Any query results are sent back to the client program. 
-The architecture described here are called two-tier architecture because the s/w components are 
distributed over two systems client and server. 
Advantages of Two-Tier: 

1.  Simplicity 
2.  seamless compatibility with existing systems 
Three-Tier and N-tier Architecture for Web Application 
Many  web  applications  use  an  architecture  called  the  three-tier  architecture,  which  adds  an 
intermediate layer between the client and the DB server.

The intermediate layer or middle tier called the application server and sometimes the web server 
depending on the application. 
-The server plays an intermediary role by storing business rules(procedure or constraints) that are 
used to access data from DB server. 
-It can improve security. 
-Client contain GUI interfaces. 
-The  intermediate  server  accepts  request  from  client,  process  the  request  and  sends  DB 
commands to the DB server, where it may processed further and output is passed to the users. 
-Thus the user interface, application rule and data access act as the three-tiers. 
-Figure1.22(b) shows another architecture used by DB and other application package vendors. 
-The presentation layer display information to the user and allows data entry. 
-The business logic layer handles intermediate rules and constraints before data is passed up top 
the user or down to the DBMS. 
-The bottom layer includes all data management services. 
-The layer b/w user and stored data can be derived in to finer components there by giving rise to 
n-tier architecture. 
-Where n may be four or five. 

Classification of DBMSs 

1.  Based on the data model: 
-  Traditional: Relational, Network, Hierarchical. 
-  Emerging: Object-oriented, Object-relational, extended Markup language model. 
2.  Based on number of users: 
-  Single-user (typically used with micro- computers) vs. Multi-user system (most DBMSs):  
    Single user systems support only one user at a time. 
    Multiuser user systems support multiple users at a time. 
3.  Based on number of sites: 
-  Centralized DBMS(uses a single computer with one database) vs. distributed DBMS(uses multiple 

computers, multiple databases). 

-     The types of DDBMS: Homogenous DDBMSs use the same DBMS s/w at multiple sites. 

 Heterogeneous DDBMSs use the different DBMS s/w at multiple sites. 

4.  DBMSs based on cost:  
 -   Some are open source (free) DBMS products available in n/w sites. The other type are sold in the 
form of licenses- site licenses allows unlimited use of the DB system with any number of copies 
running  at  the  customer  site.  Another  type  of  license  limits  the  number  of  concurrent  users  at  a 
location.   

5. Based on types of access path: accessing/Storing files in the DBMS. 
6. DBMS can be general purpose or special purpose: 
-    Ex: Airline reservations, Railway reservations and telephone directory systems are special purpose 

DBMSs. These fall under the category of online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
