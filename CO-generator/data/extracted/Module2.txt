• Entity 

Regular 

Weak 

– is anything that exists and is distinguishable 

• Attribute 

– properties that describe an entity 

• Relationship 

– an association between entities 

• ER Model (Entity Relationship Model) 
• The ER model describes data as entities, relationships, and 

attributes

Attributes 

• Entity  types  have  Attributes  (or  properties)  which  associate  each 

entity with a value from a domain of values for that attribute 

• Attribute Type: 
•

It is the property of entity type instance is called attribute type 

• Attribute Instance: 
•
• –A specific entity will have a value for each of its attributes. 

It is the property of entity instance is called attribute instance. 

For example a specific employee entity may have  
• Name='John Smith', SSN='123456789', Address ='731, Fondren, 

Houston, TX', Sex='M', BirthDate='09-JAN-55„ 

•
RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
  
 
Types of Attributes 

• Attributes can be 

– Simple v/s Composite 
– Single Valued v/s Multi-Valued 
– Stored v/s Derived 
– Key 
• Example: 

– simple (atomic) e.g. Surname; date of birth 
– composite 
– multi-valued 
– complex  
– Stored / derived e.g. D.O.B. ; age 
– Key  e.g. SSN 

e.g. address (street, town, postcode) 
e.g. phone number 
nested , multi-valued and composite 

• Relationship types can also have attributes!

Complex 
 • The composite and multi-valued attributes may be nested 
arbitrarily to any number of levels although this is rare. 

• Or  
• The combination of composite and multivalued attribute is also 

called complex attribute. 

• Composite attribute between denoted by parentheses ( ) and 

multivalued attributes between braces { }.    

• Example1: PreviousDegrees of a STUDENT is a composite multi-
valued attribute denoted by {PreviousDegrees (College, Year, 
Degree, Field)}. 

• Example2: 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Null Attirbute 

• An entity may not have any applicable value for an 

attribute. A special value is used in such situation called 
NULL. 

• Example: PhoneNo or Degree attribute of EMPLOYEE 

entity. 

The unknown category of Null is classified into two cases: 
1. The first case arises when it is know that the attribute 

value exists but is missing. 

2. The second case, when it is not known whether the 

attribute value exist or not. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
Key Attributes 

• Key = set of attributes identifying individual entities or 

relationships 

• An entity type has an attribute whose values can be used to 

identify each entity uniquely is called a key attribute. 

• Keys are one of the basic requirements of a relational database 
model. It is widely used to identify the tuples(rows) uniquely in 
the table. We also use keys to set up relations amongst various 
columns and tables of a relational database.

Different Types of Database Keys 

• Candidate Key 
• Primary Key 
• Super Key 
• Alternate Key 
• Foreign Key 
• Composite Key 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
Entity Keys 

• Super Key 

– any set of attributes that can distinguish entities 

• Candidate Key 

– a minimal Super Key 

• Can‟t remove any attribute and preserve key-ness 

– {cust-id, age} not a super key  
– {cust-name, cust-city, cust-street} is  
» assuming cust-name is not unique 

• Primary Key 

– One of the Candidate Keys chosen as the key by DBA 
– Underlined in the ER Diagram 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Super Key 

• The set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is 

known as Super Key. For Example, STUD_NO, 
(STUD_NO, STUD_NAME),  

• A super key is a group of single or multiple keys that 

identifies rows in a table.  
• It supports NULL values.  
• Adding zero or more attributes to the candidate key 

generates the super key. 

• A candidate key is a super key but vice versa is not true. 
• Super Key values may also be NULL. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
Candidate key 

An entity type may have more than one key called candidate key.   
Or 

The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known 
as a candidate key.  
For example, the CAR entity type may have two keys: 
–VehicleIdentificationNumber (popularly called VIN) and 
–VehicleTagNumber (Number, State), also known as license_plate 
number. 

RegNo 

State

Candidate key 

For Example, STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.  
•
It is a minimal super key. 
•
It is a super key with no repeated data is called a candidate key. 
• The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record. 
•
•
• Every table must have at least a single candidate key. 
• A table can have multiple candidate keys but only one primary 

It must contain unique values. 
It can contain NULL values. 

key. 

• The value of the Candidate Key is unique and may be null for a 

tuple. 

• There can be more than one candidate key in a relationship.  

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Primary Key 

• There can be more than one candidate key in relation out of which 

one can be chosen as the primary key.  
It is a unique key. 
It can identify only one tuple (a record) at a time. 
It has no duplicate values, it has unique values. 
It cannot be NULL. 

•
•
•
•
• Primary keys are not necessarily to be a single column; more than 

one column can also be a primary key for a table. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Example: 

• STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE, are candidate keys 
for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as 
the primary key (only one out of many candidate 
keys).  

• STUDENT table -> Student(STUD_NO, SNAME,  
ADDRESS, PHONE) , STUD_NO is a primary key.

Example 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Composite Key (CK) 
A key attribute may be composite. Such attribute is composite key.  
Or  
A table might not have a single column/attribute that uniquely 
identifies all the records of a table. To uniquely identify rows of a 
table, a combination of two or more columns/attributes can be used. 

For example, VehicleTagNumber is a key of the CAR entity type with 
components (Number, State). 
Example2: Flight table Flight_ID is composite key  

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
 
Continued. 

•

It still can give duplicate values in rare cases. So, we need to find 
the optimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify rows in a 
table. 
•
It acts as a primary key if there is no primary key in a table 
• Two or more attributes are used together to make a composite 

key. 

• Different combinations of attributes may give different accuracy 

in terms of identifying the rows uniquely. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Foreign Key (FK) 

•

If an attribute can only take the values which are present as values 
of some other attribute, it will be a foreign key to the attribute to 
which it refers.  

• The relation which is being referenced is called referenced 
relation and the corresponding attribute is called referenced 
attribute the relation which refers to the referenced relation is 
called referencing relation and the corresponding attribute is called 
referencing attribute.  

• The referenced attribute of the referenced relation should be the 

primary key to it. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

FK 
•

It is a key it acts as a primary key in one table and it acts as  
secondary key in another table. 
It combines two or more relations (tables) at a time. 

•
• They act as a cross-reference between the tables.

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Value set (or Domain) of attributes 

• The domain of an attribute is the set of all possible values from 

which the attributes can take its values. 

• Value sets are not displayed in ER diagrams. It is specified during 

creating entity type. 

Example1: Season attribute have the possible values are Spring, 
Summer, Autumn, Winter. 
Example2 :Gender attribute can have Female or Male. 

Mathematically Definition of value sets of attribute:  
• An attribute A of entity type E whose vale set is V can be defined as 

a function from E to the power set P(V) of  V; 

• A : E→ P(V) 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
Relationships 

• A  relationship  is    “..  An  association  among  entities  (the 
participants)..” . Relationships link entities with each other 
Express the number of entities to which another entity can be 
associated via a relationship set. 

• One-to-One

Mapping Cardinalities 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Relationship Type 

• A relationship type between two entity types defines the set of all 

association between these entity types. A relationship relates two or 
more distinct entities with a specific meaning.   

• or 
• A relationship type R among n entity types E1,E2, ,……., En defines a 

set of associations. 

Relationship set 
• An instance of a relationship set is a set of relationship. 

Relationship instance 
• Each instance of the relationship between members of these entity 

types is called a relationship instance. 

• ri = ( e1,…., en ) 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
  
 
 
 
Mathematically, the relationship set R is a set of relationship 
instance ri , where each ri  associates n individual entities ( e1,…., en ) 
and each entity ei in ri is a member of entity type Ej ,1<=j<=n. 

Where R be the relationship type. E1,E2,….En be the entity type. e1 
through en, are entity set and ri is the relationship instances. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

  
Degree of a relationship types 

• The degree of a relationship type number of entity 

participate in relationship. 
– Binary (connects 2 entity types) 
– Unary/ recursive (connects 1 entity type with itself) 
– n-ary / Complex (connects 3 or more entity types) 

• Ternary (connects 3) 

Degree 

• Structural constraints - cardinality  

– one to one (1:1) 
– one to many (1:m) 
– many to many (m:n) 

• Structural constraints – participation 

– Full(total) / mandatory 
– or partial /optional

Role names 
  • Each entity type that participates in a relationship type plays a particular role in 

the relationship. 

• Role names may be added to make the meaning more explicit. 
When to use role name? 
• The participating entity types are distinct, no need to mention role name.  
•

If the same entity type participates more than once in an r/n type in different 
roles. 
 In such cases the role name becomes essential for distinguishing the meaning 
of each participation. Such r/n types are called recursive relationship.

Attributes of relationship types 

• Relationship  types  can  also  have  attribute  similar  to  those  of 

entity type. 

• What attributes are needed to represent a relationship completely 

and uniquely ? 
– Union  of  primary  keys  of  the  entities  involved,  and 

relationship attributes 

cust-id 

access-date 

number 

customer 

has 

account 

– {cust-id,  access-date,  account-number}  describes  a  relationship 

completely 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relationship Set Keys 

• Note: Placing the attribute in relationship type i.e 1:1, 1:N 

and M:M . Representing this attribute in one of the entity type. 

• General rule for binary relationships 

– one-to-one: primary key of either entity set 
– one-to-many: primary key of the entity set on the many side 
– many-to-many: union of primary keys of the associate entity 

sets 

• n-ary relationships 

– More complicated rules 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Relationship Set Keys 

•

Is {cust-id, access-date, account-number} a candidate key ? 
– No.  Attribute  access-date  can  be  removed  from  this  set 

without losing key-ness 

– In  fact,  union  of  primary  keys  of  associated  entities  is 

always a superkey

•

If one-to-one relationship, either {cust-id} or {account-number} 
sufficient 
• Since a given customer can only have one account, He / She 

can only participate in one relationship 

• Ditto account 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
Relationship Set Keys 

•

Is {cust-id, account-number} a candidate key ? 
– Depends 

cust-id 

access-date 

number 

customer

•

If one-to-many relationship (as shown), {account-number} 
is a candidate key 
• A given customer can have many accounts, but at most 

one account holder per account allowed 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
Constraints on Relationships Types (constraints means 
restriction or limitation) 

• Relationship types have certain constraints that limit the 

possible combination of entities that may participate in the 
corresponding relationship set. 

• Example: a company has a rule that each employee must work 

•

for exactly one department. 
 There two main types of relationship constraints  
– Cardinality ratio (Maximum Cardinality constraint ) 
– Participation (also called Minimum Cardinality or 

participation constraint or existence dependency constraints) 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
Structural Constraints 

• Participation 

– Do all entity instances participate in at least one 

relationship instance? 

• Cardinality 

– How many relationship instances can an entity 

instance participate in? 

 (min, max)                (min, max) 
Participation 
0 -- Partial 
1 -- Total (Mandatory)  M -- more than one 

Cardinality 
1 -- one 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
Constraints ratio for binary Relationship 
Types 
  •
•

(Also known as ratio constraints) 
 Cardinality ratio (Maximum Cardinality) for a binary relationship 
specifies the maximum number of relationship instances that an 
entity can participate in. 
•  One-to-one (1:1) 
•    One-to-many (1:N) 
•    Many-to-one (N:1) 
•    Many-to-many (M:N) 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Participation constraint 

•

It specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being 
related to another entity the relationship types. 

• This constraint specifies the minimum number of relationship 
instances that each entity can participate in. This type is called 
Minimum Cardinality constraint. 

There are two types of Participation constraint 
1.Total Participation constraint (or existence dependency): 
2.Partial Participation constraint 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Participation Constraint 

• Given an entity set E, and a relationship R it participates in: 

– If every entity in E participates in at least one relationship in 

R, it is total participation 

– partial otherwise

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Participation Constraints 

• Does every department have a manager? 

– If so, this is a participation constraint:  the participation of  
Departments in Manages is said to be total (vs. partial). 

• Every did value in Departments table must appear in a row 

of the Manages table (with a non-null ssn value!)

Over to You now! 

• See  if  you  can  draw  an  E-R  diagram  for  this  scenario  –  you 

are already familiar with this! 
– “A student registers for up to 8 modules and each module 
has many students on it.  Record the student ID, their full 
name and address and also each module ID and title.  We 
also  want  to  hold  the  grade  attained  by  each  student  for 
each module” 

• Remember to show in your model:

Weak Entities 

• A  weak  entity can  be identified  uniquely  only  by  considering 

the primary key of another (owner) entity. 
– Owner entity set and weak entity set must participate in a one-to-many 

relationship set (one owner, many weak entities). 

– Weak  entity  set  must  have  total  participation  in  this  identifying 

relationship set.

Weak Entity Sets 

• A weak entity set must be associated with an identifying or 

owner entity set 

• Account is the owner entity set for Transaction

ER Model – Design Issues 

• Design choices: 

– Should  a  concept  be  modeled  as  an  entity  or  an 

attribute? 

– Should  a  concept  be  modeled  as  an  entity  or  a 

relationship? 

– Identifying 

relationships:  Binary  or 

ternary? 

Aggregation? 

• Constraints in the ER Model: 

– A  lot  of  data  semantics  can  (and  should)  be 

captured. 

– But  some  constraints  cannot  be  captured  in  ER 

diagrams.

Entity vs. Attribute 

• Should  address  be  an  attribute  of  Employees  or  an  entity 

(connected to Employees by a relationship)? 

• Depends  upon  the  use  we  want  to  make  of  address 

information, and the semantics of the data: 
– If we have several addresses per employee, address must 

be an entity (since attributes cannot be set-valued).  

– If  the  structure  (city,  street,  etc.)  is  important,  e.g.,  we 
want to retrieve employees in a given city, address must 
be  modeled  as  an  entity  (since  attribute  values  are 
atomic).

Constraints Beyond the ER Model 

• Some constraints cannot be captured in ER diagrams: 

•  Functional dependencies 

• 

Inclusion dependencies 

•  General constraints

Exercise – ER Model…. 

• An  Example  Database  Application  called  COMPANY 
which serves to illustrate the ER Model concepts and their 
schema design. 

The following are collection from the Client. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
Analysis… 

• Company 

: 
Organized into Departments, Each Department has a name, 
no  and  manager  who  manages  the  department.  The 
Company keeps track of the date that employee managing 
the  department.  A  Department  may  have  a  Several 
locations. 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

Analysis… 

• Department 

: 
A  Department  controls  a  number  of  Projects  each  of  which 
has a unique name , no and a single Location. 

• Employee: 

Name,  Age,  Gender,  BirthDate,  SSN,  Address,  Salary. 
An  Employee  is  assigned  to  one  department,  may 
work  on  several  projects  which  are  not  controlled  by 
the  department.  Track  of  the  number  of  hours  per 
week is also controlled. 

• Keep  track  of  the  dependents  of  each  employee  for 
insurance  policies:  We  keep  each  dependent  first  name, 
gender, Date of birth and relationship to the employee.

Example …Relationships 

• Manage: 

–  Department and Employee  
–  Partial Participation 
–  Relation Attribute: StartDate. 

• Works For: 

–  Department and Employee 
–  Total Participation 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
Example… 

•

 Control : 
– Department , Project 
– Partial Participation from Department  
–  Total Participation from Project 

• Supervisor : 

– Employee, Employee 
– Partial and Recursive 

RDBMS - Dr. AMG        

 
 
Example … 

• Works – On : 

– Project , Employee 
– Total Participation 
– Hours Worked is a RKA. 

• Dependants  of: 

– Employee, Dependant 
– Dependant is a Weaker entity 
– Dependant is Total , Employee is Partial.
