This  schema  will  describe  the \nstructures of the whole DB for community of users. It hides the details of physical storage \nstructures and includes detailed descriptions of data types, relationships and constraints; \nthese  are  expressed  using  the  concepts  provided  by  the  high-level  data  model.  These \nconcepts do not include implementation details; they are easier to understand and can be \nused to communicate with nontechnical users.  \n\nHigh level  conceptual schema is used as a reference, to  ensure all user‟s data requirements \nare  met  and  that  the  requirements  do  not  conflicts.  This  provides  the  DB  designer  to \nconcentrate  on  specifying  the  properties  of  the  data  without  concerning  with  storage \ndetails.       \n\nAfter the conceptual schema has been designed, the basic data model operation can be used \n\nto specify high level user operations identified during functional analysis. \n\nThe next step in DB design is actual implementation of the DB, using a commercial DBMS. \nConceptual  schema  is  transformed  from  the  high  level  data  model  into  the  implementation \n\ndata model.

Ordering of attributes in a relation schema R (and of values within each tuple):  \n•  The ordering of attributes is not important, because the attribute name appears with its value. \n•  There is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. \n•  The attributes in R(A1, A2, ..., An) and the values in t=<v1, v2, ..., vn> to be ordered .  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n Ex: STUDENT(“Regno”,”Name”,”Age”,”Sex”) \nValid:  t1=<”1SG04CS001”,”Aruna”,23,”F”) \nInvalid:  t2=<”aruna”,23,”!SG04CS001”,”F”) \n\n3.Values in a tuple:  \n  All values are considered atomic(indivisible).  \n  A  special  null  value  is  used  to  represent  values  that  are  unknown  or  inapplicable  to  certain \n\ntuples.  \n\n  In general, NULL values, means value unknown or value exists but is not available \n\n11.

These \nconcepts do not include implementation details; they are easier to understand and can be \nused to communicate with nontechnical users.  \n\nHigh level  conceptual schema is used as a reference, to  ensure all user‟s data requirements \nare  met  and  that  the  requirements  do  not  conflicts.  This  provides  the  DB  designer  to \nconcentrate  on  specifying  the  properties  of  the  data  without  concerning  with  storage \ndetails.       \n\nAfter the conceptual schema has been designed, the basic data model operation can be used \n\nto specify high level user operations identified during functional analysis. \n\nThe next step in DB design is actual implementation of the DB, using a commercial DBMS. \nConceptual  schema  is  transformed  from  the  high  level  data  model  into  the  implementation \n\ndata model.

Active state \n2.  Partially committed state \n3.  Committed state \n4.  Failed state \n5.  Aborted state \n6.  Terminated state \n\n1. Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are \nstill stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n3. Committed State \n\n•  After all the changes made by the transaction have been successfully stored into the \n\ndatabase, it enters into a committed state. \n\n•  Now, the transaction is considered to be fully committed. \n\nNOTE \n\n•  After a transaction has entered the committed state, it is not possible to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  This is because the system is updated into a new consistent state. \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n\f•  The only way to undo the changes is by carrying out another transaction called as \n\ncompensating transaction that performs the reverse operations. \n\n4. Failed State \nWhen a transaction is getting executed in the active state or partially committed state and some \nfailure occurs due to which it becomes impossible to continue the execution, it enters into a failed \nstate. \n\n5. Aborted State \n\n•  After the transaction has failed and entered into a failed state, all the changes made by it \n\nhave to be undone. \n\n•  To undo the changes made by the transaction, it becomes necessary to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  After the transaction has rolled back completely, it enters into an aborted state. \n\n6. Terminated State \n\n•  This is the last state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  After entering the committed state or aborted state, the transaction finally enters into a \n\nterminated state where its life cycle finally comes to an end. \n\nACID Properties in DBMS \n\nIt is important to ensure that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. \n\n• \n•  To ensure the consistency of database, certain properties are followed by all the \n\ntransactions occurring in the system. \n\n•  These properties are called as ACID Properties of a transaction. \n\nA  Atomicity \n\nC  Consistency \n\nI \n\nIsolation \n\nD  Durability \n\n1. Atomicity \n\n•  This property ensures that either the transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at \n\nall. \nIn other words, it ensures that no transaction occurs partially. \n\n• \n•  That is why, it is also referred to as ―All or nothing rule―. \n• \n\nIt is the responsibility of Transaction Control Manager to ensure atomicity of the \ntransactions. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2. Consistency \n\n•  This property ensures that integrity constraints are maintained. \n• \n\nIn other words, it ensures that the database remains consistent before and after the \ntransaction. \nIt is the responsibility of DBMS and application programmer to ensure consistency of the \ndatabase. \n\n• \n\n3. Isolation \n\n•  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without causing \n\nany inconsistency. \n\n•  During execution, each transaction feels as if it is getting executed alone in the system. \n•  A transaction does not realize that there are other transactions as well getting executed \n\nparallel. \n\n•  A change made by a transaction becomes visible to other transactions only after they are \n\nwritten in the memory. \n\n•  The resultant\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 3 Apply and 1 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO3 Apply concepts and techniques related to Transaction states are as follows- to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO4 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of It is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are experiments in database management systems"}

A  transaction  involving  only  data  retrieval  without  any  data  update  is \ncalled read- only transaction. \n\n•  Each high level operation can be divided into a number of low level tasks or operations. \n\nFor example, a data update operation can be divided into three tasks – \n\n read_item() − reads data item from storage to main memory. \n\n modify_item() − change value of item in the main memory.  \n\n write_item() − write the modified value from main memory to storage. \n\nDatabase access is restricted to read_item() and write_item() operations. Likewise, for all \ntransactions, read and write forms the basic database operations. \n\n  Executing a read_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \nsome main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as the disk block size. \n\n3.  Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X. \n\n  Executing a write_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \n\nsome main memory buffer). \n\n3.  Copy item X from the program variable named X into its correct location in the buffer. \n4.  Store the updated disk block from the buffer back to disk (either immediately or at some \n\nlater point in time). \n\n•  Types of Users \n\nSingle User \nA DBMS is single-user if at most one user at a \ntime can use the system \n\nuser \n\ndatabases \n\nSingle \nhave \nmultiprogramming  thus,  single  CPU  can  only \nexecute at most one process at a time. \n\nnot \n\ndo \n\nMulti User \nA  DBMS  is  multi-user  if  many  users  can  use \nthe  system  and  hence  access  the  database \nconcurrently. \nMultiple  users  can  access  databases  and  use \ncomputer  systems  simultaneously  because  of \nthe concept of Multiprogramming. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTransactions and Database Items \n\n•  A transaction is an executing program that forms a logical unit of database processing. \n•  A  transaction  includes  one  or  more  database  access  operations—these  can  include \n\ninsertion, deletion, modification (update), or retrieval operations. \n\n•  The  database  operations  that  form  a  transaction  can  either  be  embedded  within  an \napplication program or they can be specified interactively via a high \n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 3 Apply and 1 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using proper schema design principles\nCO3 Apply indexing strategies and query optimization techniques to improve database performance and efficiency in real-world applications\nCO4 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of Transaction in DBMS experiments in database management systems"}

If  the  database  operations  in  a  transaction  do  not  update  the \ndatabase but only retrieve data, the transaction is called a read-only transaction; otherwise \nit is known as a read-write transaction. \n\n•  Database Model : \n\nThe  database  model  that  is  used  to  present  transaction  processing  concepts  is  simple  when \ncompared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book,such as the relational model or \nthe object model. \n\nA database is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is \ncalled its granularity. A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as \na whole disk  block, or even a smaller unit such  as an individual field  (attribute) value of some \nrecord in the database. \nThe transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) \nand  apply  to  data  items  in  general.  Each  data  item  has  a  unique  name,  but  this  name  is  not \ntypically used by the programmer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item. \n\nThe main operations in a transaction are- \n\n•  Operations in Transaction \n\n1.  Read Operation \n2.  Write Operation \n\n1. Read Operation \n\n•  Read operation reads the data from the database and then stores it in the buffer in main \n\nmemory. \n\n•  Example : Read(A) instruction will read the value of A from the database and will store it \n\nin the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Write Operation \n\n•  Write operation writes the updated data value back to the database from the buffer. \n•  Example : Write(A) will write the updated value of A from the buffer to the database. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f•  Transaction States \n\nA transaction goes through many different states throughout its life cycle. \nThese states are called as transaction states. \nTransaction states are as follows- \n\n1.

Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 4 Apply and 0 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply concepts and techniques related to Multiple  users  can  access  databases  and  use to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO3 Apply concepts and techniques related to Transactions and Database Items to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO4 Apply concepts and techniques related to The transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of The main operations in a transaction are- experiments in database management systems"}

Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are \nstill stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n3. Committed State \n\n•  After all the changes made by the transaction have been successfully stored into the \n\ndatabase, it enters into a committed state. \n\n•  Now, the transaction is considered to be fully committed. \n\nNOTE \n\n•  After a transaction has entered the committed state, it is not possible to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  This is because the system is updated into a new consistent state. \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n\f•  The only way to undo the changes is by carrying out another transaction called as \n\ncompensating transaction that performs the reverse operations. \n\n4. Failed State \nWhen a transaction is getting executed in the active state or partially committed state and some \nfailure occurs due to which it becomes impossible to continue the execution, it enters into a failed \nstate. \n\n5. Aborted State \n\n•  After the transaction has failed and entered into a failed state, all the changes made by it \n\nhave to be undone. \n\n•  To undo the changes made by the transaction, it becomes necessary to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  After the transaction has rolled back completely, it enters into an aborted state. \n\n6. Terminated State \n\n•  This is the last state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  After entering the committed state or aborted state, the transaction finally enters into a \n\nterminated state where its life cycle finally comes to an end. \n\nACID Properties in DBMS \n\nIt is important to ensure that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. \n\n• \n•  To ensure the consistency of database, certain properties are followed by all the \n\ntransactions occurring in the system. \n\n•  These properties are called as ACID Properties of a transaction. \n\nA  Atomicity \n\nC  Consistency \n\nI \n\nIsolation \n\nD  Durability \n\n1. Atomicity \n\n•  This property ensures that either the transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at \n\nall. \nIn other words, it ensures that no transaction occurs partially. \n\n• \n•  That is why, it is also referred to as ―All or nothing rule―. \n• \n\nIt is the responsibility of Transaction Control Manager to ensure atomicity of the \ntransactions. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2. Consistency \n\n•  This property ensures that integrity constraints are maintained. \n• \n\nIn other words, it ensures that the database remains consistent before and after the \ntransaction. \nIt is the responsibility of DBMS and application programmer to ensure consistency of the \ndatabase. \n\n• \n\n3. Isolation \n\n•  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without causing \n\nany inconsistency. \n\n•  During execution, each transaction feels as if it is getting executed alone in the system. \n•  A transaction does not realize that there are other transactions as well getting executed \n\nparallel. \n\n•  A change made by a transaction becomes visible to other transactions only after they are \n\nwritten in the memory. \n\n•  The resultant\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 1 Apply and 3 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO3 Analyse different aspects of Transaction states are as follows- and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO4 Analyse different aspects of It is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

For Example, STUD_NO, \n(STUD_NO, STUD_NAME),  \n\n• A super key is a group of single or multiple keys that \n\nidentifies rows in a table.  \n• It supports NULL values.  \n• Adding zero or more attributes to the candidate key \n\ngenerates the super key. \n\n• A candidate key is a super key but vice versa is not true. \n• Super Key values may also be NULL. \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n \n \n\fCandidate key \n\nAn entity type may have more than one key called candidate key.   \nOr \n\nThe minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known \nas a candidate key.  \nFor example, the CAR entity type may have two keys: \n–VehicleIdentificationNumber (popularly called VIN) and \n–VehicleTagNumber (Number, State), also known as license_plate \nnumber. \n\nRegNo \n\nState  \n\nModel  \n\nMake  \n\nReg  \n\nVID \n\nYear  \n\nCAR \n\nColor  \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n  \n \n  \n\fCandidate key \n\nFor Example, STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.  \n•\nIt is a minimal super key. \n•\nIt is a super key with no repeated data is called a candidate key. \n• The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record. \n•\n•\n• Every table must have at least a single candidate key. \n• A table can have multiple candidate keys but only one primary \n\nIt must contain unique values. \nIt can contain NULL values. \n\nkey. \n\n• The value of the Candidate Key is unique and may be null for a \n\ntuple. \n\n• There can be more than one candidate key in a relationship.  \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n \n\fPrimary Key \n\n• There can be more than one candidate key in relation out of which \n\none can be chosen as the primary key.  \nIt is a unique key. \nIt can identify only one tuple (a record) at a time. \nIt has no duplicate values, it has unique values. \nIt cannot be NULL. \n\n•\n•\n•\n•\n• Primary keys are not necessarily to be a single column; more than \n\none column can also be a primary key for a table. \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n \n\fExample: \n\n• STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE, are candidate keys \nfor relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as \nthe primary key (only one out of many candidate \nkeys).  \n\n• STUDENT table -> Student(STUD_NO, SNAME,  \nADDRESS, PHONE) , STUD_NO is a primary key. \n\nTable STUDENT \n\nSTUD_NO            \n\nSNAME             \n\nADDRESS             PHONE                       \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\nShyam \n\nRakesh \n\nSuraj \n\nDelhi \n\n123456789 \n\nKolkata \n\n223365796 \n\nDelhi \n\n175468965 \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n  \n\fExample \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n\fComposite Key (CK) \nA key attribute may be composite. Such attribute is composite key.  \nOr  \nA table might not have a single column/attribute that uniquely \nidentifies all the records of a table. To uniquely identify rows of a \ntable, a combination of two or more columns/attributes can be used. \n\nFor example, VehicleTagNumber is a key of the CAR entity type with \ncomponents (Number, State). \nExample2: Flight table Flight_ID is composite key  \n\nRDBMS - Dr. AMG        \n\n \n \n \n \n\fContinued. \n\n•\n\nIt still can give duplicate values in rare cases.

In terms of functionality delivered.  \n\nReplication \n\nReplication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application \nand it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be \ncopied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReplication \n\nBy doing this, will get \nredundancy and increases \ndata availability with \nmultiple copies of data on \ndifferent database servers.  \n\nSo, it will increase the \nperformance of reading \nscaling. The set of servers \nthat maintain the same \ncopy of data is known as \nreplica servers or \nMongoDB instances \n\n \n\fReplication \n\n\fSharding \n\nSharding is a method for allocating data across multiple machines. MongoDB used sharding to help deployment \nwith very big data sets and large throughput the operation. By sharding, you combine more devices to carry data \nextension and the needs of read and write operations. \n\nWhy Sharding? \n• Database systems having big data sets or high throughput requests can doubt the ability of a single server. \n• For example, High query flows can drain the CPU limit of the server. \n• The working set sizes are larger than the system’s RAM to stress the I/O capacity of the disk drive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nNow, instead of one signal as primary, \nwe have multiple servers called Shard. \nWe have different routing servers that \nwill route data to the shard servers. For \nexample: Let say we have Data 1, Data \n2, and Data 3 this will be going to the \nrouting server which will route the data \n(i.e, Different Data will go to a particular \nShard ) Each Shard holds some pieces \nof data.

Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute. Hence, for those attributes we can only add the \nattributes themselves in their closures. Therefore, \n{Marks}+ = {Marks} \n\nand \n\n{Location}+ = { Location} \n\nExample-2 : Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) having below mentioned \nfunctional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : A→  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\n Now, we need to calculate the closure of attributes of the relation R. The \nclosures will be: \n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {B, C} \n\n{D}+ = {D, E} \n\n{E}+ = {E} \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Calculating Candidate Key \n\n  “A Candidate Key of a relation is an attribute or set of attributes that can \ndetermine the whole relation or contains all the attributes in its closure.\" \n\n  Let’s try to understand how to calculate candidate keys. \n\nExample-1 : Consider the relation R(A,B,C) with given functional dependencies : \n\nFD1 : A → B \n\n \n  \n \n \n\fFD2 : B→  C \n\nNow, calculating the closure of the attributes as : \n\n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B, C} \n\n{C}+ = {C} \nClearly, “A” is the candidate key as, its closure contains all the attributes \npresent in the relation “R”. \n\nExample-2 : Consider another relation R(A, B, C, D, E) having the Functional \ndependencies : \n\nFD1 : A  →  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\nNow, calculating the closure of the attributes as : \n\n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {C, B} \n\n{D}+ = {E, D} \n\n{E}+ = {E, D} \nIn this case, a single attribute is unable to determine all the attribute on its own \nlike in previous example. Here, we need to combine two or more attributes to \ndetermine the candidate keys. \n\n{A, D}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \n\n{A, E}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \nHence, \"AD\" and \"AE\" are the two possible keys of the given relation “R”. Any \nother combination other than these two would have acted as extraneous \nattributes. \n\n  \n\fNOTE : Any relation “R” can have either single or multiple candidate keys. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Key Definitions \n\n1.  Prime Attributes : Attributes which are indispensable part of candidate \nkeys. For example : “A, D, E” attributes are prime attributes in above \nexample-2. \n\n2.  Non-Prime Attributes : Attributes other than prime attributes which does \n\nnot take part in formation of candidate keys. For example. \n\n3.  Extraneous Attributes : Attributes which does not make any effect on \n\nremoval from candidate key. \n\nFor example : Consider the relation R(A, B, C, D) with functional dependencies : \n\nFD1 : A → BC \n\nFD2 : B → C \n\nFD3 : D→  C \n\nHere, Candidate key can be “AD” only. Hence, \n\nPrime Attributes : A, D. \n\nNon-Prime Attributes : B, C \n\nExtraneous Attributes : B, C(As if we add any of the to the candidate key, it will \nremain unaffected).

Atomic  means  it  must \nhappen entirely or not at all. \nExample:  If  J  wants  to  transfer  Rs2000  from  his  account  to  S.  If  a  system  failure \noccur  during  execution  of  the  program,  that  Rs2000  is  removed  from  J  but  not \ncredited  to  account  S,  resulting  in  an  inconsistent  state.

Active state \n2.  Partially committed state \n3.  Committed state \n4.  Failed state \n5.  Aborted state \n6.  Terminated state \n\n1. Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are \nstill stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n3. Committed State \n\n•  After all the changes made by the transaction have been successfully stored into the \n\ndatabase, it enters into a committed state. \n\n•  Now, the transaction is considered to be fully committed. \n\nNOTE \n\n•  After a transaction has entered the committed state, it is not possible to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  This is because the system is updated into a new consistent state. \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n\f•  The only way to undo the changes is by carrying out another transaction called as \n\ncompensating transaction that performs the reverse operations. \n\n4. Failed State \nWhen a transaction is getting executed in the active state or partially committed state and some \nfailure occurs due to which it becomes impossible to continue the execution, it enters into a failed \nstate. \n\n5. Aborted State \n\n•  After the transaction has failed and entered into a failed state, all the changes made by it \n\nhave to be undone. \n\n•  To undo the changes made by the transaction, it becomes necessary to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  After the transaction has rolled back completely, it enters into an aborted state. \n\n6. Terminated State \n\n•  This is the last state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  After entering the committed state or aborted state, the transaction finally enters into a \n\nterminated state where its life cycle finally comes to an end. \n\nACID Properties in DBMS \n\nIt is important to ensure that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. \n\n• \n•  To ensure the consistency of database, certain properties are followed by all the \n\ntransactions occurring in the system. \n\n•  These properties are called as ACID Properties of a transaction. \n\nA  Atomicity \n\nC  Consistency \n\nI \n\nIsolation \n\nD  Durability \n\n1.

Isolation \n\n•  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without causing \n\nany inconsistency. \n\n•  During execution, each transaction feels as if it is getting executed alone in the system. \n•  A transaction does not realize that there are other transactions as well getting executed \n\nparallel. \n\n•  A change made by a transaction becomes visible to other transactions only after they are \n\nwritten in the memory. \n\n•  The resultant\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 0 Apply and 4 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO2 Analyse different aspects of Transaction states are as follows- and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO3 Analyse different aspects of It is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO4 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

Ordering of attributes in a relation schema R (and of values within each tuple):  \n•  The ordering of attributes is not important, because the attribute name appears with its value. \n•  There is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. \n•  The attributes in R(A1, A2, ..., An) and the values in t=<v1, v2, ..., vn> to be ordered .  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n Ex: STUDENT(“Regno”,”Name”,”Age”,”Sex”) \nValid:  t1=<”1SG04CS001”,”Aruna”,23,”F”) \nInvalid:  t2=<”aruna”,23,”!SG04CS001”,”F”) \n\n3.Values in a tuple:  \n  All values are considered atomic(indivisible).  \n  A  special  null  value  is  used  to  represent  values  that  are  unknown  or  inapplicable  to  certain \n\ntuples.  \n\n  In general, NULL values, means value unknown or value exists but is not available \n\n11. Relational Model Notation: \n\n•  A relational schema R of degree n is denoted by   R(A1 ,..,An). \n•  An  n-tuple  t  in  a  relation  r(R)  is  denoted  by  t=<v1,.,vn  >,where  vi  is  the  value \n\ncorresponding to attribute Ai. \n\n•  The component values of a tuple t by t[Ai] = vi (the value of attribute Ai for tuple t). \nSimilarly, t[Au, Av, ..., Aw] refers to the subtuple of t containing the values    \n\n           <vu,vw,..,vz>attributes Au, Av,., Aw, respectively. \n\n•  The letters Q,R,S denote relation names. \n•  The letters q,r,s denote relation states. \n•  The letters t,u,v denote tuples. \n•  STUDENT(SSN,Name,..)  refers  to  the  relation  schema.  The  name  of  a  relation  schema \n\nindicates the current set of tuples in the relation. \n\n•  An  attribute  A  can  be  qualified  with  the  relation  name  by  R.A-  Eg.STUDENT.Name  or \n\nSTUDENT.Age. \n\nNote:- the same name may be used for two attributes in different relations. \nt[Name]=<„Barbara Benson‟> \nt[Name,SSN,Age]=<„Barbara‟,‟563-789‟,23> \nt=<„Barbara Benson‟,‟563-789‟,23,null,3.45>   \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n 12.

Inherent model-based or implicit constraints \nConstraints that is inherent in a data model. \nExample: The constraint that a relation cannot have duplicate values \n\n2.  Schema-based or explicit constraints \n\nThis type of constraint can be expressed directly in schemas of the data model by \nspecifying in DDL \n\n• \n\n There are four main types of constraints: \n\n1.  Domain constraints \n2.  Key constraints \n3.  Entity integrity constraints \n4.  Referential integrity constraints  \n\nDomain Constraints \n\n•  Domain constraints specify that the value of each attribute A must be an atomic value from \n\nthe domain dom(A) for that attribute. \n\nExample : Domain is given a name, datatype and format. \n Student_Name Varchar(30) \n\nDatatype associated with domains typically include \n• \nInteger ( short-integer, integer, long-integer ) \n•  Real Number ( float and double-precision float) \n•  Character \n•  Fixed and Variable length string  \n•  Date and Time \n•  Money \n\nDomain Constraint = data type + Constraints (NOT NULL / UNIQUE / PRIMARY \nKEY / FOREIGN KEY / CHECK / DEFAULT) \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\nTypes of keys: \n\n1.

There  is  no  application  program  on \nhand to meet it in the original system. \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\nThe file-processing systems do not allow needed data to be retrieved in a convenient \nand efficient manner. \n\n  Data  isolation:  The  data  are  scattered  in  various  files,  and  files  may  be  different \nformats,  it  is  difficult  to  write  new  application  programs  to  retrieve  the  appropriate \ndata.  \n\n  Integrity problems: The data values stored in the database must satisfy certain types \n\nof consistency constraints. \nExample:  The  balance  of  a  bank  account  may  never  fall  below  Rs.100.  Developers \nenforce  these  constraints  in  the  system  by  adding  code  in  the  various  application \nprograms. If new constraints wanted to add, it is difficult to change the programs.    \n\n  Atomicity  problems:  If  any  mechanical  or  electrical  types  of  failure  occur  to  the \nsystem,  the  data  should  be  restored  to  the  consistent  state.  Atomic  means  it  must \nhappen entirely or not at all. \nExample:  If  J  wants  to  transfer  Rs2000  from  his  account  to  S.  If  a  system  failure \noccur  during  execution  of  the  program,  that  Rs2000  is  removed  from  J  but  not \ncredited  to  account  S,  resulting  in  an  inconsistent  state.  To  stay  in  consistent  state \neither both credit and debit occur, or that neither occur. \n\nCUSTOMER_SAVING \n\nAccount_number  Name \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nJagadish \n123567 \n\nFigure1.4 Atomicity problems \n\nAge \n26 \n27 \n28 \n\nBalance  \n12000 \n15000 \n18000 \ninconsistent state \n\nAddress \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \n#323,Bangalore \n\n  Concurrent  access  anomalies:  System  allows  multiple  users  to  update,  delete  and \nretrieve  the  data  simultaneously.  If  two  programs  run  concurrently,  they  may  both \nread  the  value,  and  write  back  the  value.  Depending  on  which  one  writes  the  value \nlast, that value maybe correct or incorrect value. \nExample:    If  two  customers  withdraw  amount  from  J  (say  Rs200  and  Rs300 \nrespectively)  at  the  same  time,  the  result  of  concurrent  executions  may  leave  the \naccount in an incorrect state. \n\n  Security problem: Not every user of the database system should be able to access all \n\nthe data. \nExample: In a student database system, updating marks is allowed only for lecturer, \nonly viewing the data for student and restricted for updating the data. \n\n  Limited data sharing \n\n  Poor enforcement of standards \n\n\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 0 Apply and 4 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO2 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO3 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO4 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

Characteristics Of Relations \n1.  Ordering of tuples in a relation r(R):  \n•  The tuples are not considered to be ordered, even though they appear to be in the tabular form.  \n\nThe relation does not require this ordering \n\n2.  Ordering of attributes in a relation schema R (and of values within each tuple):  \n•  The ordering of attributes is not important, because the attribute name appears with its value. \n•  There is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. \n•  The attributes in R(A1, A2, ..., An) and the values in t=<v1, v2, ..., vn> to be ordered .  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n Ex: STUDENT(“Regno”,”Name”,”Age”,”Sex”) \nValid:  t1=<”1SG04CS001”,”Aruna”,23,”F”) \nInvalid:  t2=<”aruna”,23,”!SG04CS001”,”F”) \n\n3.Values in a tuple:  \n  All values are considered atomic(indivisible).  \n  A  special  null  value  is  used  to  represent  values  that  are  unknown  or  inapplicable  to  certain \n\ntuples.  \n\n  In general, NULL values, means value unknown or value exists but is not available \n\n11.

A  transaction  involving  only  data  retrieval  without  any  data  update  is \ncalled read- only transaction. \n\n•  Each high level operation can be divided into a number of low level tasks or operations. \n\nFor example, a data update operation can be divided into three tasks – \n\n read_item() − reads data item from storage to main memory. \n\n modify_item() − change value of item in the main memory.  \n\n write_item() − write the modified value from main memory to storage. \n\nDatabase access is restricted to read_item() and write_item() operations. Likewise, for all \ntransactions, read and write forms the basic database operations. \n\n  Executing a read_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \nsome main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as the disk block size. \n\n3.  Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X. \n\n  Executing a write_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \n\nsome main memory buffer). \n\n3.

If  the  database  operations  in  a  transaction  do  not  update  the \ndatabase but only retrieve data, the transaction is called a read-only transaction; otherwise \nit is known as a read-write transaction. \n\n•  Database Model : \n\nThe  database  model  that  is  used  to  present  transaction  processing  concepts  is  simple  when \ncompared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book,such as the relational model or \nthe object model. \n\nA database is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is \ncalled its granularity. A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as \na whole disk  block, or even a smaller unit such  as an individual field  (attribute) value of some \nrecord in the database. \nThe transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) \nand  apply  to  data  items  in  general.  Each  data  item  has  a  unique  name,  but  this  name  is  not \ntypically used by the programmer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item. \n\nThe main operations in a transaction are- \n\n•  Operations in Transaction \n\n1.  Read Operation \n2.  Write Operation \n\n1. Read Operation \n\n•  Read operation reads the data from the database and then stores it in the buffer in main \n\nmemory. \n\n•  Example : Read(A) instruction will read the value of A from the database and will store it \n\nin the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Write Operation \n\n•  Write operation writes the updated data value back to the database from the buffer. \n•  Example : Write(A) will write the updated value of A from the buffer to the database. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f•  Transaction States \n\nA transaction goes through many different states throughout its life cycle. \nThese states are called as transaction states. \nTransaction states are as follows- \n\n1.

If  the  database  operations  in  a  transaction  do  not  update  the \ndatabase but only retrieve data, the transaction is called a read-only transaction; otherwise \nit is known as a read-write transaction. \n\n•  Database Model : \n\nThe  database  model  that  is  used  to  present  transaction  processing  concepts  is  simple  when \ncompared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book,such as the relational model or \nthe object model. \n\nA database is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is \ncalled its granularity. A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as \na whole disk  block, or even a smaller unit such  as an individual field  (attribute) value of some \nrecord in the database. \nThe transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) \nand  apply  to  data  items  in  general.  Each  data  item  has  a  unique  name,  but  this  name  is  not \ntypically used by the programmer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item. \n\nThe main operations in a transaction are- \n\n•  Operations in Transaction \n\n1.  Read Operation \n2.  Write Operation \n\n1. Read Operation \n\n•  Read operation reads the data from the database and then stores it in the buffer in main \n\nmemory. \n\n•  Example : Read(A) instruction will read the value of A from the database and will store it \n\nin the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Write Operation \n\n•  Write operation writes the updated data value back to the database from the buffer. \n•  Example : Write(A) will write the updated value of A from the buffer to the database. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f•  Transaction States \n\nA transaction goes through many different states throughout its life cycle. \nThese states are called as transaction states. \nTransaction states are as follows- \n\n1.  Active state \n2.  Partially committed state \n3.  Committed state \n4.  Failed state \n5.  Aborted state \n6.  Terminated state \n\n1. Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 2 Apply and 2 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply concepts and techniques related to Multiple  users  can  access  databases  and  use to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO3 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO4 Analyse different aspects of Transactions and Database Items and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of The transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) experiments in database management systems"}

Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute.

Here, we need to combine two or more attributes to \ndetermine the candidate keys. \n\n{A, D}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \n\n{A, E}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \nHence, \"AD\" and \"AE\" are the two possible keys of the given relation “R”.

Imparting clear semantics of the attributes \n\n• Semantics of a relation : \n\nInterpretation of attribute values in a tuple. \nIf semantics of a relation are easier to understand, relation schema design will be better. \nExample : Simplified COMPANY schema \n\n• Guidelines \n\n  Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning. \n  Do not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into single \n\nrelation. \n\n• Example : \n\n•  A tuple in emp_dept represents a single employee but includes additional information like \n\nDname, DMGSSN \n\n•  A tuple in emp_proj has additional information like Ename, Pname, Plocation. \n•  This is considered as poor designs because they violate Guideline1 by mixing attributes \n\nfrom distinct real world entities. \n\n•  EMP_DEPT mixes attributes of employees and departments. \n•  EMP_PROJ mixes attributes of employees, projects and works_on \n\n2.

In terms of functionality delivered.  \n\nReplication \n\nReplication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application \nand it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be \ncopied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReplication \n\nBy doing this, will get \nredundancy and increases \ndata availability with \nmultiple copies of data on \ndifferent database servers.  \n\nSo, it will increase the \nperformance of reading \nscaling. The set of servers \nthat maintain the same \ncopy of data is known as \nreplica servers or \nMongoDB instances \n\n \n\fReplication \n\n\fSharding \n\nSharding is a method for allocating data across multiple machines. MongoDB used sharding to help deployment \nwith very big data sets and large throughput the operation. By sharding, you combine more devices to carry data \nextension and the needs of read and write operations. \n\nWhy Sharding? \n• Database systems having big data sets or high throughput requests can doubt the ability of a single server. \n• For example, High query flows can drain the CPU limit of the server. \n• The working set sizes are larger than the system’s RAM to stress the I/O capacity of the disk drive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nNow, instead of one signal as primary, \nwe have multiple servers called Shard. \nWe have different routing servers that \nwill route data to the shard servers. For \nexample: Let say we have Data 1, Data \n2, and Data 3 this will be going to the \nrouting server which will route the data \n(i.e, Different Data will go to a particular \nShard ) Each Shard holds some pieces \nof data. Here the configuration server will \nhold the metadata and it will configure \nthe routing server to integrate the \nparticular data to a shard however \nconfigure server is the MongoDB \ninstance if it goes down then the entire \nserver will go down, So it again has \nReplica Configure database \n\n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nAdvantages of Sharding :  \n• Sharding adds more server to a data field \nautomatically adjust data loads across various \nservers. \n• The number of operations each shard manage \ngot reduced. \n• It also increases the write capacity by splitting \nthe write load over multiple instances. \n• It gives high availability due to the deployment \nof replica servers for shard and config. \n• Total capacity will get increased by adding \nmultiple shards. \n\n\fGeoSpatial Queries \n\nMongoDB provides the functionality to store locations under the object type geoJSON and their coordinates \nagainst the coordinate field in [longitude, latitude] form where longitude must lie between [-180, 180] and latitude \nmust lie between [-90,90], both inclusive. \n\ngeoJSON types that are provided by MongoDB \n\n1.

Major) \n\nTranscript (Name, Course, Grade) \n\nTeacher (Course Professor) \n\nThese decomposition are bad for the following reasons : \n\n(i)\" Redundancy and update anomaly, because the data for the attributes phone no. and major \n\nare repeated. \n\n(ii) Loss of information, because we lose the fact that a student has a given grade in a particular \n\ncourse. \n\nTerms used in Normalization \n\n1.  Determinant \n\nAttribute X is defined as determinant if it uniquely defines the attribute value Y in an entity. \nXY means X decides Y \nHere, X is a determinant and Y is dependent \nExample : Result_Details \nHere, marks attribute decides Grade attribute. \nMarksGrade \nNote : Marks may not be key attribute \n\n2.  Functional Dependency \n\nThe functional dependency is a relationship that exists between two attributes. It typically \n\nexists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table. \n\nX   →   Y   \n\nThe left side of FD is known as a determinant, the right side of the production is known \nas a dependent. \n\nConsider the following relation. \nReport (student#, course#, coursename, Iname, room#, marks, grade) \nHere \nDept. of AIML, DSCE \n\npg. 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDatabase Management System (18CS53) \n\nModule 4 \n\nStudent#course# (composite key) defines exactly one value for marks. \nStudent#course#  Marks \nHence, Marks is functionally dependent on student#course# \n\nArmstrong’s axioms/properties of functional dependencies: \n\n1.  Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X→Y holds by reflexivity rule \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → name is valid. \n\n2.  Augmentation: If X → Y is a valid dependency, then XZ → YZ is also valid by the \n\naugmentation rule. \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → dept_building is valid, hence {roll_no, name, dept_name} → \n\n{dept_building, dept_name} is also valid. \n\n3.  Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z are both valid dependencies, then X→Z is also valid by the \n\nTransitivity rule. \n\nExample, roll_no → dept_name & dept_name → dept_building, then roll_no → dept_building is \n\nalso valid. \n\nTypes of Functional Dependency \n\n1.

Here, we need to combine two or more attributes to \ndetermine the candidate keys. \n\n{A, D}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \n\n{A, E}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \nHence, \"AD\" and \"AE\" are the two possible keys of the given relation “R”.

Imparting clear semantics of the attributes \n2.  Reducing the redundant information in tuples. \n3.  Reducing Null values in tuples. \n4.  Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples. \n\n1. Imparting clear semantics of the attributes \n\n• Semantics of a relation : \n\nInterpretation of attribute values in a tuple. \nIf semantics of a relation are easier to understand, relation schema design will be better. \nExample : Simplified COMPANY schema \n\n• Guidelines \n\n  Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning. \n  Do not combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into single \n\nrelation. \n\n• Example : \n\n•  A tuple in emp_dept represents a single employee but includes additional information like \n\nDname, DMGSSN \n\n•  A tuple in emp_proj has additional information like Ename, Pname, Plocation. \n•  This is considered as poor designs because they violate Guideline1 by mixing attributes \n\nfrom distinct real world entities. \n\n•  EMP_DEPT mixes attributes of employees and departments. \n•  EMP_PROJ mixes attributes of employees, projects and works_on \n\n2.

This is not possible because SSN \n\nis a primary key. \n\nb)  Modification anomaly \n\nIf we change value of manager of department of 5, we must update all those tuples of employees \nwho work in that department, else inconsistency occurs. \n\nc)  Deletion anomaly \n\nTrying to delete employee tuple where only one record is left out, the information about that \ndepartment is lost from the data base. \n\n• Guideline \n\nDesign the base relation schemas so that no insertion, deletion or modification anomalies are \npresent in the relations. \n\n3. Reducing Null values in tuples \nRelations should have as few NULL values as possible because \n\n•  Wastage of memory at the storage level \n•  Difficult with aggregation functions like count, avg. \n•  Difficult with join operations because the results will be unpredictable. \n\n4.

A  transaction  involving  only  data  retrieval  without  any  data  update  is \ncalled read- only transaction. \n\n•  Each high level operation can be divided into a number of low level tasks or operations. \n\nFor example, a data update operation can be divided into three tasks – \n\n read_item() − reads data item from storage to main memory. \n\n modify_item() − change value of item in the main memory.  \n\n write_item() − write the modified value from main memory to storage. \n\nDatabase access is restricted to read_item() and write_item() operations. Likewise, for all \ntransactions, read and write forms the basic database operations. \n\n  Executing a read_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \nsome main memory buffer).

Major) \n\nTranscript (Name, Course, Grade) \n\nTeacher (Course Professor) \n\nThese decomposition are bad for the following reasons : \n\n(i)\" Redundancy and update anomaly, because the data for the attributes phone no. and major \n\nare repeated. \n\n(ii) Loss of information, because we lose the fact that a student has a given grade in a particular \n\ncourse. \n\nTerms used in Normalization \n\n1.  Determinant \n\nAttribute X is defined as determinant if it uniquely defines the attribute value Y in an entity. \nXY means X decides Y \nHere, X is a determinant and Y is dependent \nExample : Result_Details \nHere, marks attribute decides Grade attribute. \nMarksGrade \nNote : Marks may not be key attribute \n\n2.  Functional Dependency \n\nThe functional dependency is a relationship that exists between two attributes. It typically \n\nexists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table. \n\nX   →   Y   \n\nThe left side of FD is known as a determinant, the right side of the production is known \nas a dependent. \n\nConsider the following relation. \nReport (student#, course#, coursename, Iname, room#, marks, grade) \nHere \nDept. of AIML, DSCE \n\npg. 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDatabase Management System (18CS53) \n\nModule 4 \n\nStudent#course# (composite key) defines exactly one value for marks. \nStudent#course#  Marks \nHence, Marks is functionally dependent on student#course# \n\nArmstrong’s axioms/properties of functional dependencies: \n\n1.  Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X→Y holds by reflexivity rule \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → name is valid. \n\n2.  Augmentation: If X → Y is a valid dependency, then XZ → YZ is also valid by the \n\naugmentation rule. \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → dept_building is valid, hence {roll_no, name, dept_name} → \n\n{dept_building, dept_name} is also valid. \n\n3.  Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z are both valid dependencies, then X→Z is also valid by the \n\nTransitivity rule. \n\nExample, roll_no → dept_name & dept_name → dept_building, then roll_no → dept_building is \n\nalso valid. \n\nTypes of Functional Dependency \n\n1.

Relational Model Notation: \n\n•  A relational schema R of degree n is denoted by   R(A1 ,..,An). \n•  An  n-tuple  t  in  a  relation  r(R)  is  denoted  by  t=<v1,.,vn  >,where  vi  is  the  value \n\ncorresponding to attribute Ai. \n\n•  The component values of a tuple t by t[Ai] = vi (the value of attribute Ai for tuple t). \nSimilarly, t[Au, Av, ..., Aw] refers to the subtuple of t containing the values    \n\n           <vu,vw,..,vz>attributes Au, Av,., Aw, respectively. \n\n•  The letters Q,R,S denote relation names. \n•  The letters q,r,s denote relation states. \n•  The letters t,u,v denote tuples. \n•  STUDENT(SSN,Name,..)  refers  to  the  relation  schema.  The  name  of  a  relation  schema \n\nindicates the current set of tuples in the relation. \n\n•  An  attribute  A  can  be  qualified  with  the  relation  name  by  R.A-  Eg.STUDENT.Name  or \n\nSTUDENT.Age. \n\nNote:- the same name may be used for two attributes in different relations. \nt[Name]=<„Barbara Benson‟> \nt[Name,SSN,Age]=<„Barbara‟,‟563-789‟,23> \nt=<„Barbara Benson‟,‟563-789‟,23,null,3.45>   \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n 12.

Inherent model-based or implicit constraints \nConstraints that is inherent in a data model. \nExample: The constraint that a relation cannot have duplicate values \n\n2.  Schema-based or explicit constraints \n\nThis type of constraint can be expressed directly in schemas of the data model by \nspecifying in DDL \n\n• \n\n There are four main types of constraints: \n\n1.  Domain constraints \n2.  Key constraints \n3.  Entity integrity constraints \n4.  Referential integrity constraints  \n\nDomain Constraints \n\n•  Domain constraints specify that the value of each attribute A must be an atomic value from \n\nthe domain dom(A) for that attribute. \n\nExample : Domain is given a name, datatype and format. \n Student_Name Varchar(30) \n\nDatatype associated with domains typically include \n• \nInteger ( short-integer, integer, long-integer ) \n•  Real Number ( float and double-precision float) \n•  Character \n•  Fixed and Variable length string  \n•  Date and Time \n•  Money \n\nDomain Constraint = data type + Constraints (NOT NULL / UNIQUE / PRIMARY \nKEY / FOREIGN KEY / CHECK / DEFAULT) \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\nTypes of keys: \n\n1.

In terms of functionality delivered.  \n\nReplication \n\nReplication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application \nand it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be \ncopied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReplication \n\nBy doing this, will get \nredundancy and increases \ndata availability with \nmultiple copies of data on \ndifferent database servers.  \n\nSo, it will increase the \nperformance of reading \nscaling. The set of servers \nthat maintain the same \ncopy of data is known as \nreplica servers or \nMongoDB instances \n\n \n\fReplication \n\n\fSharding \n\nSharding is a method for allocating data across multiple machines. MongoDB used sharding to help deployment \nwith very big data sets and large throughput the operation. By sharding, you combine more devices to carry data \nextension and the needs of read and write operations. \n\nWhy Sharding? \n• Database systems having big data sets or high throughput requests can doubt the ability of a single server. \n• For example, High query flows can drain the CPU limit of the server. \n• The working set sizes are larger than the system’s RAM to stress the I/O capacity of the disk drive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nNow, instead of one signal as primary, \nwe have multiple servers called Shard. \nWe have different routing servers that \nwill route data to the shard servers. For \nexample: Let say we have Data 1, Data \n2, and Data 3 this will be going to the \nrouting server which will route the data \n(i.e, Different Data will go to a particular \nShard ) Each Shard holds some pieces \nof data. Here the configuration server will \nhold the metadata and it will configure \nthe routing server to integrate the \nparticular data to a shard however \nconfigure server is the MongoDB \ninstance if it goes down then the entire \nserver will go down, So it again has \nReplica Configure database \n\n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nAdvantages of Sharding :  \n• Sharding adds more server to a data field \nautomatically adjust data loads across various \nservers. \n• The number of operations each shard manage \ngot reduced. \n• It also increases the write capacity by splitting \nthe write load over multiple instances. \n• It gives high availability due to the deployment \nof replica servers for shard and config. \n• Total capacity will get increased by adding \nmultiple shards. \n\n\fGeoSpatial Queries \n\nMongoDB provides the functionality to store locations under the object type geoJSON and their coordinates \nagainst the coordinate field in [longitude, latitude] form where longitude must lie between [-180, 180] and latitude \nmust lie between [-90,90], both inclusive. \n\ngeoJSON types that are provided by MongoDB \n\n1.

In file processing system \nthe permanent records are stored in various files, and different application programs are written \nto  extract  records  from,  and  to  add  records  to  appropriate  files.  To  keep  organizational \ninformation in a file processing system has some disadvantage \n\n  Data redundancy: The same data stored in multiple places. This leads uncontrolled \nredundancy in file system. This redundancy leads higher storage and access cost. \nExample: Two files of Banking system have savings-account records and a checking-\naccount record contains the two common fields i.e. address and telephone of customer \nappear in both files.  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\nCUSTOMER_SAVING \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \n\nAge \n25 \n26 \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n\n CHECKING_ACCOUNT \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nFigure1.2 Data redundancy \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \n\n  Inconsistency data: Incorrectness in data entry. \n\nExample:  A  changes  made  in  customer  address  in  savings-account  records  will  be \nreflected but not in other files of banking system this makes the data inconsistency. \n\nCUSTOMER_SAVING \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nJagadish \n123567 \nArun \n123467 \n\nAge \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n25 \n\nBalance  \n20000 \n12000 \n15000 \n20000 \n20000 \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \n#323,Bangalore \n#45,Bangalore \n\nSpelling Mistake in name field \n\n CHECKING_ACCOUNT \nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nJagadish \n123567 \n\nFigure1.3 Data Inconsistency \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \nNull \n\nChanges not reflected \n\n  Inflexibility: If any necessary changes like adding a file or extend the data elements \nin an existing file the entire file has to be changed.

X+ := X;    \n2.  repeat    \n3.   oldX+ := X+ ;    \n4.   for each functional dependency Y → Z in F do    \n5.        if X+ ⊇ Y then X+ := X+ ∪ Z;    \n6.   until (X+ = oldX+ );   \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Introduction \n\n  The Closure Of Functional Dependency means the complete set of all possible \nattributes that can be functionally derived from given functional dependency \nusing the inference rules known as Armstrong’s Rules. \nIf “F” is a functional dependency then closure of functional dependency can be \ndenoted using “{F}+”. \n\n \n\n  There are three steps to calculate closure of functional dependency. These are: \n\nStep-1 : Add the attributes which are present on Left Hand Side in the original \nfunctional dependency. \n\nStep-2 : Now, add the attributes present on the Right Hand Side of the functional \ndependency. \n\nStep-3 : With the help of attributes present on Right Hand Side, check the other \nattributes that can be derived from the other given functional dependencies. Repeat this \nprocess until all the possible attributes which can be derived are added in the closure. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Examples \n\n\fExample-1 : Consider the table student_details having (Roll_No, Name,Marks, \nLocation) as the attributes and having two functional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : Roll_No → Name, Marks \n\nFD2 : Name   →Marks, Location \n\nNow, We will calculate the closure of all the attributes present in the relation \nusing the three steps mentioned below. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present  on the LHS of the first functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No} \n\nStep-2 : Add attributes present on the RHS of the original functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks} \n\nStep-3 : Add the other possible attributes which can be derived using attributes present \non the RHS of the closure. So Roll_No attribute cannot functionally determine any \nattribute but Name attribute can determine other attributes such as Marks and \nLocation using 2nd Functional Dependency(Name [icon name=\"long-arrow-right\" \nclass=\"\" unprefixed_class=\"\"] Marks, Location). \nTherefore, complete closure of Roll_No will be : \n\n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks, Name, Location} \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate closure for other attributes too i.e “Name”. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present on the LHS of the functional dependency to the closure. \n{Name}+ = {Name} \n\nStep-2 : Add the attributes present on the RHS of the functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\nStep-3 : Since, we don’t have any functional dependency where “Marks or Location” \nattribute is functionally determining any other attribute , we cannot add more \nattributes to the closure. Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute. Hence, for those attributes we can only add the \nattributes themselves in their closures. Therefore, \n{Marks}+ = {Marks} \n\nand \n\n{Location}+ = { Location} \n\nExample-2 : Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) having below mentioned \nfunctional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : A→  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\n Now, we need to calculate the closure of attributes of the relation R. The \nclosures will be: \n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {B, C} \n\n{D}+ = {D, E} \n\n{E}+ = {E} \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Calculating\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 3 Apply and 1 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using proper schema design principles\nCO2 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO3 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using database management principles\nCO4 Analyse a given scenario and use suitable database technique to address real-world database problems and challenges\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

Major) \n\nTranscript (Name, Course, Grade) \n\nTeacher (Course Professor) \n\nThese decomposition are bad for the following reasons : \n\n(i)\" Redundancy and update anomaly, because the data for the attributes phone no. and major \n\nare repeated. \n\n(ii) Loss of information, because we lose the fact that a student has a given grade in a particular \n\ncourse. \n\nTerms used in Normalization \n\n1.  Determinant \n\nAttribute X is defined as determinant if it uniquely defines the attribute value Y in an entity. \nXY means X decides Y \nHere, X is a determinant and Y is dependent \nExample : Result_Details \nHere, marks attribute decides Grade attribute. \nMarksGrade \nNote : Marks may not be key attribute \n\n2.

Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X→Y holds by reflexivity rule \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → name is valid. \n\n2.  Augmentation: If X → Y is a valid dependency, then XZ → YZ is also valid by the \n\naugmentation rule. \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → dept_building is valid, hence {roll_no, name, dept_name} → \n\n{dept_building, dept_name} is also valid. \n\n3.

To  keep  organizational \ninformation in a file processing system has some disadvantage \n\n  Data redundancy: The same data stored in multiple places. This leads uncontrolled \nredundancy in file system. This redundancy leads higher storage and access cost. \nExample: Two files of Banking system have savings-account records and a checking-\naccount record contains the two common fields i.e. address and telephone of customer \nappear in both files.  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\nCUSTOMER_SAVING \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \n\nAge \n25 \n26 \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n\n CHECKING_ACCOUNT \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nFigure1.2 Data redundancy \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \n\n  Inconsistency data: Incorrectness in data entry. \n\nExample:  A  changes  made  in  customer  address  in  savings-account  records  will  be \nreflected but not in other files of banking system this makes the data inconsistency. \n\nCUSTOMER_SAVING \n\nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nJagadish \n123567 \nArun \n123467 \n\nAge \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n25 \n\nBalance  \n20000 \n12000 \n15000 \n20000 \n20000 \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \n#323,Bangalore \n#45,Bangalore \n\nSpelling Mistake in name field \n\n CHECKING_ACCOUNT \nAccount_number  Name \nAruna \n123467 \nSuri  \n123469 \nMohan \n123468 \nJagadish \n123567 \n\nFigure1.3 Data Inconsistency \n\nAddress \n#45,Bangalore \n#35,hassan \n#23,Bangalore \nNull \n\nChanges not reflected \n\n  Inflexibility: If any necessary changes like adding a file or extend the data elements \nin an existing file the entire file has to be changed.

Domain \n\n•  A domain D is a set of atomic values. \n•  Atomic means values are distinct & indivisible. \n•  A domain is given a name, data type & format. \n\nExample:  \n\nDomain Name        Datatype         Format \nDoJ \nPhno                   String        ddd-ddd-dddddd \n\n     date           mm-dd-yyyy \n\n6. Relational Schema \n\n•  A  relational  schema  R,  denoted  by  R(A1,…An)  is  made  up  of  relation  name  R  &  list  of \n\nattributes A1,A2…An. \n\n•  Each attribute Ai is the name of a role played by some domain D in the relation schema R. \n•  D is called the domain of Ai & denoted by dom(Ai). \n•  A relation schema is used to describe a relation:  R is called name of the relation. \n\n7. Degree of Relation \n\n•  The total number of attributes in a relation is called degree (or arity) of relation.  \n\nExample: \n\n•  STUDENT(Name, SSN, HomePhone, Address, OfficePhone, Age, GRA) \n\nNo. of Attribute = 7 \nThe degree of relation STUDENT is 7 \n\n•  The domain for the attributes of the STUDENT are dom(Name)=Names  \n\ndom(SSN)=Social_Security_Number \n\n8.

Characteristics Of Relations \n1.  Ordering of tuples in a relation r(R):  \n•  The tuples are not considered to be ordered, even though they appear to be in the tabular form.  \n\nThe relation does not require this ordering \n\n2.  Ordering of attributes in a relation schema R (and of values within each tuple):  \n•  The ordering of attributes is not important, because the attribute name appears with its value. \n•  There is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. \n•  The attributes in R(A1, A2, ..., An) and the values in t=<v1, v2, ..., vn> to be ordered .  \n\nDept of AI&ML,DSCE,Bangalore \n\nPage 4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDBMS[22AI33]  2023 \n\n Ex: STUDENT(“Regno”,”Name”,”Age”,”Sex”) \nValid:  t1=<”1SG04CS001”,”Aruna”,23,”F”) \nInvalid:  t2=<”aruna”,23,”!SG04CS001”,”F”) \n\n3.Values in a tuple:  \n  All values are considered atomic(indivisible).  \n  A  special  null  value  is  used  to  represent  values  that  are  unknown  or  inapplicable  to  certain \n\ntuples.  \n\n  In general, NULL values, means value unknown or value exists but is not available \n\n11.

Functional  requirement  is  specified  by  using \ndata flow diagrams, sequence diagrams, scenarios and other techniques. \n\nOnce all the requirement have been collected and analyzed. \nThe  next  step  is  to  create  a  conceptual  schema  for  the  DB,  using  a  high-level  conceptual \ndata  model.  This  step  is  called  conceptual  DB  design.  This  schema  will  describe  the \nstructures of the whole DB for community of users. It hides the details of physical storage \nstructures and includes detailed descriptions of data types, relationships and constraints; \nthese  are  expressed  using  the  concepts  provided  by  the  high-level  data  model.

Likewise, for all \ntransactions, read and write forms the basic database operations. \n\n  Executing a read_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \nsome main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as the disk block size. \n\n3.  Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X. \n\n  Executing a write_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \n\nsome main memory buffer). \n\n3.

X+ := X;    \n2.  repeat    \n3.   oldX+ := X+ ;    \n4.   for each functional dependency Y → Z in F do    \n5.        if X+ ⊇ Y then X+ := X+ ∪ Z;    \n6.   until (X+ = oldX+ );   \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Introduction \n\n  The Closure Of Functional Dependency means the complete set of all possible \nattributes that can be functionally derived from given functional dependency \nusing the inference rules known as Armstrong’s Rules. \nIf “F” is a functional dependency then closure of functional dependency can be \ndenoted using “{F}+”. \n\n \n\n  There are three steps to calculate closure of functional dependency. These are: \n\nStep-1 : Add the attributes which are present on Left Hand Side in the original \nfunctional dependency. \n\nStep-2 : Now, add the attributes present on the Right Hand Side of the functional \ndependency. \n\nStep-3 : With the help of attributes present on Right Hand Side, check the other \nattributes that can be derived from the other given functional dependencies. Repeat this \nprocess until all the possible attributes which can be derived are added in the closure. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Examples \n\n\fExample-1 : Consider the table student_details having (Roll_No, Name,Marks, \nLocation) as the attributes and having two functional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : Roll_No → Name, Marks \n\nFD2 : Name   →Marks, Location \n\nNow, We will calculate the closure of all the attributes present in the relation \nusing the three steps mentioned below. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present  on the LHS of the first functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No} \n\nStep-2 : Add attributes present on the RHS of the original functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks} \n\nStep-3 : Add the other possible attributes which can be derived using attributes present \non the RHS of the closure. So Roll_No attribute cannot functionally determine any \nattribute but Name attribute can determine other attributes such as Marks and \nLocation using 2nd Functional Dependency(Name [icon name=\"long-arrow-right\" \nclass=\"\" unprefixed_class=\"\"] Marks, Location). \nTherefore, complete closure of Roll_No will be : \n\n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks, Name, Location} \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate closure for other attributes too i.e “Name”. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present on the LHS of the functional dependency to the closure. \n{Name}+ = {Name} \n\nStep-2 : Add the attributes present on the RHS of the functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\nStep-3 : Since, we don’t have any functional dependency where “Marks or Location” \nattribute is functionally determining any other attribute , we cannot add more \nattributes to the closure. Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute. Hence, for those attributes we can only add the \nattributes themselves in their closures. Therefore, \n{Marks}+ = {Marks} \n\nand \n\n{Location}+ = { Location} \n\nExample-2 : Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) having below mentioned \nfunctional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : A→  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\n Now, we need to calculate the closure of attributes of the relation R.

These are: \n\nStep-1 : Add the attributes which are present on Left Hand Side in the original \nfunctional dependency. \n\nStep-2 : Now, add the attributes present on the Right Hand Side of the functional \ndependency. \n\nStep-3 : With the help of attributes present on Right Hand Side, check the other \nattributes that can be derived from the other given functional dependencies. Repeat this \nprocess until all the possible attributes which can be derived are added in the closure. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Examples \n\n\fExample-1 : Consider the table student_details having (Roll_No, Name,Marks, \nLocation) as the attributes and having two functional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : Roll_No → Name, Marks \n\nFD2 : Name   →Marks, Location \n\nNow, We will calculate the closure of all the attributes present in the relation \nusing the three steps mentioned below. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present  on the LHS of the first functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No} \n\nStep-2 : Add attributes present on the RHS of the original functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks} \n\nStep-3 : Add the other possible attributes which can be derived using attributes present \non the RHS of the closure. So Roll_No attribute cannot functionally determine any \nattribute but Name attribute can determine other attributes such as Marks and \nLocation using 2nd Functional Dependency(Name [icon name=\"long-arrow-right\" \nclass=\"\" unprefixed_class=\"\"] Marks, Location). \nTherefore, complete closure of Roll_No will be : \n\n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks, Name, Location} \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate closure for other attributes too i.e “Name”. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present on the LHS of the functional dependency to the closure. \n{Name}+ = {Name} \n\nStep-2 : Add the attributes present on the RHS of the functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\nStep-3 : Since, we don’t have any functional dependency where “Marks or Location” \nattribute is functionally determining any other attribute , we cannot add more \nattributes to the closure. Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute. Hence, for those attributes we can only add the \nattributes themselves in their closures.

X+ := X;    \n2.  repeat    \n3.   oldX+ := X+ ;    \n4.   for each functional dependency Y → Z in F do    \n5.        if X+ ⊇ Y then X+ := X+ ∪ Z;    \n6.   until (X+ = oldX+ );   \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Introduction \n\n  The Closure Of Functional Dependency means the complete set of all possible \nattributes that can be functionally derived from given functional dependency \nusing the inference rules known as Armstrong’s Rules. \nIf “F” is a functional dependency then closure of functional dependency can be \ndenoted using “{F}+”. \n\n \n\n  There are three steps to calculate closure of functional dependency. These are: \n\nStep-1 : Add the attributes which are present on Left Hand Side in the original \nfunctional dependency. \n\nStep-2 : Now, add the attributes present on the Right Hand Side of the functional \ndependency. \n\nStep-3 : With the help of attributes present on Right Hand Side, check the other \nattributes that can be derived from the other given functional dependencies. Repeat this \nprocess until all the possible attributes which can be derived are added in the closure. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Examples \n\n\fExample-1 : Consider the table student_details having (Roll_No, Name,Marks, \nLocation) as the attributes and having two functional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : Roll_No → Name, Marks \n\nFD2 : Name   →Marks, Location \n\nNow, We will calculate the closure of all the attributes present in the relation \nusing the three steps mentioned below. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present  on the LHS of the first functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No} \n\nStep-2 : Add attributes present on the RHS of the original functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks} \n\nStep-3 : Add the other possible attributes which can be derived using attributes present \non the RHS of the closure. So Roll_No attribute cannot functionally determine any \nattribute but Name attribute can determine other attributes such as Marks and \nLocation using 2nd Functional Dependency(Name [icon name=\"long-arrow-right\" \nclass=\"\" unprefixed_class=\"\"] Marks, Location). \nTherefore, complete closure of Roll_No will be : \n\n{Roll_no}+ = {Roll_No, Marks, Name, Location} \n\nSimilarly, we can calculate closure for other attributes too i.e “Name”. \n\nStep-1 : Add attributes present on the LHS of the functional dependency to the closure. \n{Name}+ = {Name} \n\nStep-2 : Add the attributes present on the RHS of the functional dependency to the \nclosure. \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\nStep-3 : Since, we don’t have any functional dependency where “Marks or Location” \nattribute is functionally determining any other attribute , we cannot add more \nattributes to the closure. Hence complete closure of Name would be : \n{Name}+ = {Name, Marks, Location} \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n\fNOTE : We don’t have any Functional dependency where marks and location can \nfunctionally determine any attribute. Hence, for those attributes we can only add the \nattributes themselves in their closures. Therefore, \n{Marks}+ = {Marks} \n\nand \n\n{Location}+ = { Location} \n\nExample-2 : Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) having below mentioned \nfunctional dependencies. \n\nFD1 : A→  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\n Now, we need to calculate the closure of attributes of the relation R. The \nclosures will be: \n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {B, C} \n\n{D}+ = {D, E} \n\n{E}+ = {E} \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Calculating\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 4 Apply and 0 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using proper schema design principles\nCO2 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO3 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using database management principles\nCO4 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using database management principles\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

Now  in  several  commercial  products  (DB2,  ORACLE,  SQL  Server,  SYBASE, \nINFORMIX). \n\n•  The table is called a relation, a row is called a tuple, and column header is called attribute. \n1.  Relational Model \n\nIt represents database as a collection of relations. \n\n• \n•  A relation (table) contains rows and columns. \n•  Each column represents one type of information. \n•  Each row represents related data. \n\n2.  Relation \n\n•  The main construct for representing data in relational model is called relation. \n• \n•  When a relation is thought of as a table of values, each row in the table represents a \n\nIn relational model terminology, the table is called a relation. \n\ncollection of related data values. \n\n•  The table name and column names are used to help in interpreting the meaning of the \n\nvalues in each row. \n\n•  A relation may be thought of as a set of rows and set of columns. \n•  Each row represents a fact that corresponds to a real-world entity or relationship. \n•  Each row has a value of an item or set of items that uniquely identifies that row in the \n\ntable. \n\n•  Sometimes row-ids or sequential numbers are assigned to identify the rows in the table. \n•  Each  column  typically  is  called  by  its  column  name  or  column  header  or  attribute \n\nname. \n\nUSN \n1DS21AI001 \n1DS20AI045 \n1DS22AI010 \n1DS20AI012 \n\nNAME \nAjay \nSanujana \nGupta \nAkash  \n\nSEMESTER  MARKS \n5 \n7 \n3 \n7 \n\n78.8 \n67.4 \n68.3 \n81.3 \n\n3.

Developers \nenforce  these  constraints  in  the  system  by  adding  code  in  the  various  application \nprograms. If new constraints wanted to add, it is difficult to change the programs.    \n\n  Atomicity  problems:  If  any  mechanical  or  electrical  types  of  failure  occur  to  the \nsystem,  the  data  should  be  restored  to  the  consistent  state.  Atomic  means  it  must \nhappen entirely or not at all. \nExample:  If  J  wants  to  transfer  Rs2000  from  his  account  to  S.  If  a  system  failure \noccur  during  execution  of  the  program,  that  Rs2000  is  removed  from  J  but  not \ncredited  to  account  S,  resulting  in  an  inconsistent  state.

If  two  programs  run  concurrently,  they  may  both \nread  the  value,  and  write  back  the  value.  Depending  on  which  one  writes  the  value \nlast, that value maybe correct or incorrect value. \nExample:    If  two  customers  withdraw  amount  from  J  (say  Rs200  and  Rs300 \nrespectively)  at  the  same  time,  the  result  of  concurrent  executions  may  leave  the \naccount in an incorrect state. \n\n  Security problem: Not every user of the database system should be able to access all \n\nthe data. \nExample: In a student database system, updating marks is allowed only for lecturer, \nonly viewing the data for student and restricted for updating the data. \n\n  Limited data sharing \n\n  Poor enforcement of standards \n\n\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 4 Apply and 0 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using proper schema design principles\nCO3 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO4 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using database management principles\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

In terms of functionality delivered.  \n\nReplication \n\nReplication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application \nand it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be \ncopied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReplication \n\nBy doing this, will get \nredundancy and increases \ndata availability with \nmultiple copies of data on \ndifferent database servers.  \n\nSo, it will increase the \nperformance of reading \nscaling. The set of servers \nthat maintain the same \ncopy of data is known as \nreplica servers or \nMongoDB instances \n\n \n\fReplication \n\n\fSharding \n\nSharding is a method for allocating data across multiple machines. MongoDB used sharding to help deployment \nwith very big data sets and large throughput the operation. By sharding, you combine more devices to carry data \nextension and the needs of read and write operations. \n\nWhy Sharding? \n• Database systems having big data sets or high throughput requests can doubt the ability of a single server. \n• For example, High query flows can drain the CPU limit of the server. \n• The working set sizes are larger than the system’s RAM to stress the I/O capacity of the disk drive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nNow, instead of one signal as primary, \nwe have multiple servers called Shard. \nWe have different routing servers that \nwill route data to the shard servers. For \nexample: Let say we have Data 1, Data \n2, and Data 3 this will be going to the \nrouting server which will route the data \n(i.e, Different Data will go to a particular \nShard ) Each Shard holds some pieces \nof data. Here the configuration server will \nhold the metadata and it will configure \nthe routing server to integrate the \nparticular data to a shard however \nconfigure server is the MongoDB \ninstance if it goes down then the entire \nserver will go down, So it again has \nReplica Configure database \n\n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nAdvantages of Sharding :  \n• Sharding adds more server to a data field \nautomatically adjust data loads across various \nservers. \n• The number of operations each shard manage \ngot reduced. \n• It also increases the write capacity by splitting \nthe write load over multiple instances. \n• It gives high availability due to the deployment \nof replica servers for shard and config. \n• Total capacity will get increased by adding \nmultiple shards. \n\n\fGeoSpatial Queries \n\nMongoDB provides the functionality to store locations under the object type geoJSON and their coordinates \nagainst the coordinate field in [longitude, latitude] form where longitude must lie between [-180, 180] and latitude \nmust lie between [-90,90], both inclusive. \n\ngeoJSON types that are provided by MongoDB \n\n1.

The \nclosures will be: \n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {B, C} \n\n{D}+ = {D, E} \n\n{E}+ = {E} \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Calculating Candidate Key \n\n  “A Candidate Key of a relation is an attribute or set of attributes that can \ndetermine the whole relation or contains all the attributes in its closure.\" \n\n  Let’s try to understand how to calculate candidate keys. \n\nExample-1 : Consider the relation R(A,B,C) with given functional dependencies : \n\nFD1 : A → B \n\n \n  \n \n \n\fFD2 : B→  C \n\nNow, calculating the closure of the attributes as : \n\n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B, C} \n\n{C}+ = {C} \nClearly, “A” is the candidate key as, its closure contains all the attributes \npresent in the relation “R”. \n\nExample-2 : Consider another relation R(A, B, C, D, E) having the Functional \ndependencies : \n\nFD1 : A  →  BC \n\nFD2 : C→  B \n\nFD3 : D → E \n\nFD4 : E → D \n\nNow, calculating the closure of the attributes as : \n\n{A}+ = {A, B, C} \n\n{B}+ = {B} \n\n{C}+ = {C, B} \n\n{D}+ = {E, D} \n\n{E}+ = {E, D} \nIn this case, a single attribute is unable to determine all the attribute on its own \nlike in previous example. Here, we need to combine two or more attributes to \ndetermine the candidate keys. \n\n{A, D}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \n\n{A, E}+ = {A, B, C, D, E} \nHence, \"AD\" and \"AE\" are the two possible keys of the given relation “R”. Any \nother combination other than these two would have acted as extraneous \nattributes. \n\n  \n\fNOTE : Any relation “R” can have either single or multiple candidate keys. \n\nClosure Of Functional Dependency : Key Definitions \n\n1.  Prime Attributes : Attributes which are indispensable part of candidate \nkeys. For example : “A, D, E” attributes are prime attributes in above \nexample-2. \n\n2.  Non-Prime Attributes : Attributes other than prime attributes which does \n\nnot take part in formation of candidate keys. For example. \n\n3.  Extraneous Attributes : Attributes which does not make any effect on \n\nremoval from candidate key. \n\nFor example : Consider the relation R(A, B, C, D) with functional dependencies : \n\nFD1 : A → BC \n\nFD2 : B → C \n\nFD3 : D→  C \n\nHere, Candidate key can be “AD” only. Hence, \n\nPrime Attributes : A, D. \n\nNon-Prime Attributes : B, C \n\nExtraneous Attributes : B, C(As if we add any of the to the candidate key, it will \nremain unaffected). Those attributes, which if removed does not affect closure \nof that set. \n\nhttps://minigranth.in/dbms-tutorial/canonical-cover-of-functional-dependency \n\nConsider the following  Supplier Database schema:  Solve using SQL and relational algebra \nSUPPLIERS (sid: integer, sname: string, address: string)  \nPARTS (pid: integer, pname: string, color: string)  \nCATALOG (sid: integer, pid: integer, cost: real) \n1.

These \nconcepts do not include implementation details; they are easier to understand and can be \nused to communicate with nontechnical users.  \n\nHigh level  conceptual schema is used as a reference, to  ensure all user‟s data requirements \nare  met  and  that  the  requirements  do  not  conflicts.

A  transaction  involving  only  data  retrieval  without  any  data  update  is \ncalled read- only transaction. \n\n•  Each high level operation can be divided into a number of low level tasks or operations. \n\nFor example, a data update operation can be divided into three tasks – \n\n read_item() − reads data item from storage to main memory. \n\n modify_item() − change value of item in the main memory.  \n\n write_item() − write the modified value from main memory to storage. \n\nDatabase access is restricted to read_item() and write_item() operations. Likewise, for all \ntransactions, read and write forms the basic database operations. \n\n  Executing a read_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \nsome main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as the disk block size. \n\n3.  Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X. \n\n  Executing a write_item(X) command includes the following steps: \n1.  Find the address of the disk block that contains item X. \n2.  Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not already in \n\nsome main memory buffer). \n\n3.  Copy item X from the program variable named X into its correct location in the buffer. \n4.  Store the updated disk block from the buffer back to disk (either immediately or at some \n\nlater point in time). \n\n•  Types of Users \n\nSingle User \nA DBMS is single-user if at most one user at a \ntime can use the system \n\nuser \n\ndatabases \n\nSingle \nhave \nmultiprogramming  thus,  single  CPU  can  only \nexecute at most one process at a time. \n\nnot \n\ndo \n\nMulti User \nA  DBMS  is  multi-user  if  many  users  can  use \nthe  system  and  hence  access  the  database \nconcurrently. \nMultiple  users  can  access  databases  and  use \ncomputer  systems  simultaneously  because  of \nthe concept of Multiprogramming. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fTransactions and Database Items \n\n•  A transaction is an executing program that forms a logical unit of database processing. \n•  A  transaction  includes  one  or  more  database  access  operations—these  can  include \n\ninsertion, deletion, modification (update), or retrieval operations. \n\n•  The  database  operations  that  form  a  transaction  can  either  be  embedded  within  an \napplication program or they can be specified interactively via a high \n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 4 Apply and 0 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply DBMS concepts to design and create databases that address specific real-world scenarios using proper schema design principles\nCO3 Apply indexing strategies and query optimization techniques to improve database performance and efficiency in real-world applications\nCO4 Apply concepts and techniques related to Transaction in DBMS to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of Database access is restricted to read_item() and write_item() operations.

It typically \n\nexists between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table. \n\nX   →   Y   \n\nThe left side of FD is known as a determinant, the right side of the production is known \nas a dependent. \n\nConsider the following relation. \nReport (student#, course#, coursename, Iname, room#, marks, grade) \nHere \nDept. of AIML, DSCE \n\npg. 13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDatabase Management System (18CS53) \n\nModule 4 \n\nStudent#course# (composite key) defines exactly one value for marks. \nStudent#course#  Marks \nHence, Marks is functionally dependent on student#course# \n\nArmstrong’s axioms/properties of functional dependencies: \n\n1.  Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X→Y holds by reflexivity rule \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → name is valid. \n\n2.  Augmentation: If X → Y is a valid dependency, then XZ → YZ is also valid by the \n\naugmentation rule. \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → dept_building is valid, hence {roll_no, name, dept_name} → \n\n{dept_building, dept_name} is also valid. \n\n3.  Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z are both valid dependencies, then X→Z is also valid by the \n\nTransitivity rule. \n\nExample, roll_no → dept_name & dept_name → dept_building, then roll_no → dept_building is \n\nalso valid. \n\nTypes of Functional Dependency \n\n1.  Trivial FD : \n\n A functional dependency of the form X   Y is trivial if Y  ⊆ X. \nOr  \n\no  A → B has trivial functional dependency if B is a subset of A. \n\no  The following dependencies are also trivial like: A → A, B → B \n\nExample: \n\nDept. of AIML, DSCE \n\npg. 14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fDatabase Management System (18CS53) \n\nModule 4 \n\nroll_no  name \n\nage \n\n42 \n\nabc \n\n17 \n\n43 \n\npqr \n\n18 \n\n44 \n\nxyz \n\n18 \n\nHere, {roll_no,  name}  →  name is  a  trivial  functional  dependency,  since  the  dependent name is  a \n\nsubset of\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 0 Apply and 4 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Analyse different aspects of decomposition and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO2 Analyse different aspects of student#course# (composite key) defines exactly one value for marks. and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO3 Analyse different aspects of roll_no  name and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO4 Analyse different aspects of similarly, {roll_no,  name}  →  age is  also  a  non-trivial  functional  dependency,  since age is not  a and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of Normalization Helps: experiments in database management systems"}

If  the  database  operations  in  a  transaction  do  not  update  the \ndatabase but only retrieve data, the transaction is called a read-only transaction; otherwise \nit is known as a read-write transaction. \n\n•  Database Model : \n\nThe  database  model  that  is  used  to  present  transaction  processing  concepts  is  simple  when \ncompared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book,such as the relational model or \nthe object model. \n\nA database is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is \ncalled its granularity. A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as \na whole disk  block, or even a smaller unit such  as an individual field  (attribute) value of some \nrecord in the database. \nThe transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) \nand  apply  to  data  items  in  general.  Each  data  item  has  a  unique  name,  but  this  name  is  not \ntypically used by the programmer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item. \n\nThe main operations in a transaction are- \n\n•  Operations in Transaction \n\n1.  Read Operation \n2.  Write Operation \n\n1. Read Operation \n\n•  Read operation reads the data from the database and then stores it in the buffer in main \n\nmemory. \n\n•  Example : Read(A) instruction will read the value of A from the database and will store it \n\nin the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Write Operation \n\n•  Write operation writes the updated data value back to the database from the buffer. \n•  Example : Write(A) will write the updated value of A from the buffer to the database. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f•  Transaction States \n\nA transaction goes through many different states throughout its life cycle. \nThese states are called as transaction states. \nTransaction states are as follows- \n\n1.  Active state \n2.  Partially committed state \n3.  Committed state \n4.  Failed state \n5.  Aborted state \n6.  Terminated state \n\n1. Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 1 Apply and 3 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO3 Analyse different aspects of Multiple  users  can  access  databases  and  use and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO4 Analyse different aspects of Transactions and Database Items and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of The transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) experiments in database management systems"}

Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are \nstill stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n3. Committed State \n\n•  After all the changes made by the transaction have been successfully stored into the \n\ndatabase, it enters into a committed state. \n\n•  Now, the transaction is considered to be fully committed. \n\nNOTE \n\n•  After a transaction has entered the committed state, it is not possible to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  This is because the system is updated into a new consistent state. \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n\f•  The only way to undo the changes is by carrying out another transaction called as \n\ncompensating transaction that performs the reverse operations. \n\n4. Failed State \nWhen a transaction is getting executed in the active state or partially committed state and some \nfailure occurs due to which it becomes impossible to continue the execution, it enters into a failed \nstate. \n\n5. Aborted State \n\n•  After the transaction has failed and entered into a failed state, all the changes made by it \n\nhave to be undone. \n\n•  To undo the changes made by the transaction, it becomes necessary to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  After the transaction has rolled back completely, it enters into an aborted state. \n\n6. Terminated State \n\n•  This is the last state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  After entering the committed state or aborted state, the transaction finally enters into a \n\nterminated state where its life cycle finally comes to an end. \n\nACID Properties in DBMS \n\nIt is important to ensure that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. \n\n• \n•  To ensure the consistency of database, certain properties are followed by all the \n\ntransactions occurring in the system. \n\n•  These properties are called as ACID Properties of a transaction. \n\nA  Atomicity \n\nC  Consistency \n\nI \n\nIsolation \n\nD  Durability \n\n1. Atomicity \n\n•  This property ensures that either the transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at \n\nall. \nIn other words, it ensures that no transaction occurs partially. \n\n• \n•  That is why, it is also referred to as ―All or nothing rule―. \n• \n\nIt is the responsibility of Transaction Control Manager to ensure atomicity of the \ntransactions. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2. Consistency \n\n•  This property ensures that integrity constraints are maintained. \n• \n\nIn other words, it ensures that the database remains consistent before and after the \ntransaction. \nIt is the responsibility of DBMS and application programmer to ensure consistency of the \ndatabase. \n\n• \n\n3. Isolation \n\n•  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without causing \n\nany inconsistency. \n\n•  During execution, each transaction feels as if it is getting executed alone in the system. \n•  A transaction does not realize that there are other transactions as well getting executed \n\nparallel. \n\n•  A change made by a transaction becomes visible to other transactions only after they are \n\nwritten in the memory. \n\n•  The resultant\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 4 Apply and 0 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO3 Apply concepts and techniques related to Transaction states are as follows- to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO4 Apply concepts and techniques related to It is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are to solve practical problems and address real-world database scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of DBMS experiment"}

Active state \n2.  Partially committed state \n3.  Committed state \n4.  Failed state \n5.  Aborted state \n6.  Terminated state \n\n1. Active State \n\n•  This is the first state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  A transaction is called in an active state as long as its instructions are getting executed. \n•  All the changes made by the transaction now are stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Partially Committed State \n\n•  After the last instruction of transaction has executed, it enters into a partially committed \n\nstate. \n\n•  After entering this state, the transaction is considered to be partially committed. \n• \n\nIt is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are \nstill stored in the buffer in main memory. \n\n3. Committed State \n\n•  After all the changes made by the transaction have been successfully stored into the \n\ndatabase, it enters into a committed state. \n\n•  Now, the transaction is considered to be fully committed. \n\nNOTE \n\n•  After a transaction has entered the committed state, it is not possible to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  This is because the system is updated into a new consistent state. \n\n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n\f•  The only way to undo the changes is by carrying out another transaction called as \n\ncompensating transaction that performs the reverse operations. \n\n4. Failed State \nWhen a transaction is getting executed in the active state or partially committed state and some \nfailure occurs due to which it becomes impossible to continue the execution, it enters into a failed \nstate. \n\n5. Aborted State \n\n•  After the transaction has failed and entered into a failed state, all the changes made by it \n\nhave to be undone. \n\n•  To undo the changes made by the transaction, it becomes necessary to roll back the \n\ntransaction. \n\n•  After the transaction has rolled back completely, it enters into an aborted state. \n\n6. Terminated State \n\n•  This is the last state in the life cycle of a transaction. \n•  After entering the committed state or aborted state, the transaction finally enters into a \n\nterminated state where its life cycle finally comes to an end. \n\nACID Properties in DBMS \n\nIt is important to ensure that the database remains consistent before and after the transaction. \n\n• \n•  To ensure the consistency of database, certain properties are followed by all the \n\ntransactions occurring in the system. \n\n•  These properties are called as ACID Properties of a transaction. \n\nA  Atomicity \n\nC  Consistency \n\nI \n\nIsolation \n\nD  Durability \n\n1. Atomicity \n\n•  This property ensures that either the transaction occurs completely or it does not occur at \n\nall. \nIn other words, it ensures that no transaction occurs partially. \n\n• \n•  That is why, it is also referred to as ―All or nothing rule―. \n• \n\nIt is the responsibility of Transaction Control Manager to ensure atomicity of the \ntransactions. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2. Consistency \n\n•  This property ensures that integrity constraints are maintained. \n• \n\nIn other words, it ensures that the database remains consistent before and after the \ntransaction. \nIt is the responsibility of DBMS and application programmer to ensure consistency of the \ndatabase. \n\n• \n\n3. Isolation \n\n•  This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without causing \n\nany inconsistency. \n\n•  During execution, each transaction feels as if it is getting executed alone in the system. \n•  A transaction does not realize that there are other transactions as well getting executed \n\nparallel. \n\n•  A change made by a transaction becomes visible to other transactions only after they are \n\nwritten in the memory. \n\n•  The resultant\n\nRequirements:\n- CO1-CO4: Mix of 2 Apply and 2 Analyze levels\n- CO5: Evaluate level (experiments/tools)\n- CO6: Create level (reports/writing)\n- Each CO must be 15-20 words and cover major syllabus topics\n- Format: CO1 [action verb] [detailed statement]", "output": "CO1 Demonstrate the various SQL & Relational algebra query processing techniques to retrieve and manipulate data from database systems\nCO2 Apply normalization techniques and database design principles to create efficient database structures for real-world applications\nCO3 Analyse a given scenario involving database transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms to use suitable database techniques\nCO4 Analyse different aspects of Transaction states are as follows- and their applications to solve complex database problems and address real-world scenarios\nCO5 Ability to conduct experiments as individual or team to using modern database tools for database management and operations\nCO6 Write clear and concise experiment reports that detail the methods, results, and conclusions of It is not considered fully committed because all the changes made by the transaction are experiments in database management systems"}

If  the  database  operations  in  a  transaction  do  not  update  the \ndatabase but only retrieve data, the transaction is called a read-only transaction; otherwise \nit is known as a read-write transaction. \n\n•  Database Model : \n\nThe  database  model  that  is  used  to  present  transaction  processing  concepts  is  simple  when \ncompared to the data models that we discussed earlier in the book,such as the relational model or \nthe object model. \n\nA database is basically represented as a collection of named data items. The size of a data item is \ncalled its granularity. A data item can be a database record, but it can also be a larger unit such as \na whole disk  block, or even a smaller unit such  as an individual field  (attribute) value of some \nrecord in the database. \nThe transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) \nand  apply  to  data  items  in  general.  Each  data  item  has  a  unique  name,  but  this  name  is  not \ntypically used by the programmer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item. \n\nThe main operations in a transaction are- \n\n•  Operations in Transaction \n\n1.  Read Operation \n2.  Write Operation \n\n1. Read Operation \n\n•  Read operation reads the data from the database and then stores it in the buffer in main \n\nmemory. \n\n•  Example : Read(A) instruction will read the value of A from the database and will store it \n\nin the buffer in main memory. \n\n2. Write Operation \n\n•  Write operation writes the updated data value back to the database from the buffer. \n•  Example : Write(A) will write the updated value of A from the buffer to the database. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f•  Transaction States \n\nA transaction goes through many different states throughout its life cycle. \nThese states are called as transaction states. \nTransaction states are as follows- \n\n1.

In terms of functionality delivered.  \n\nReplication \n\nReplication is the method of duplication of data across multiple servers. For example, we have an application \nand it reads and writes data to a database and says this server A has a name and balance which will be \ncopied/replicate to two other servers in two different locations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fReplication \n\nBy doing this, will get \nredundancy and increases \ndata availability with \nmultiple copies of data on \ndifferent database servers.  \n\nSo, it will increase the \nperformance of reading \nscaling. The set of servers \nthat maintain the same \ncopy of data is known as \nreplica servers or \nMongoDB instances \n\n \n\fReplication \n\n\fSharding \n\nSharding is a method for allocating data across multiple machines. MongoDB used sharding to help deployment \nwith very big data sets and large throughput the operation. By sharding, you combine more devices to carry data \nextension and the needs of read and write operations. \n\nWhy Sharding? \n• Database systems having big data sets or high throughput requests can doubt the ability of a single server. \n• For example, High query flows can drain the CPU limit of the server. \n• The working set sizes are larger than the system’s RAM to stress the I/O capacity of the disk drive. \n\n \n \n \n \n\fSharding \n\nHow does Sharding work? \nSharding determines the problem with horizontal scaling breaking the system dataset and store over \nmultiple servers, adding new servers to increase the volume as needed. \n\nNow, instead of one signal as primary, \nwe have multiple servers called Shard. \nWe have different routing servers that \nwill route data to the shard servers. For \nexample: Let say we have Data 1, Data \n2, and Data 3 this will be going to the \nrouting server which will route the data \n(i.e, Different Data will go to a particular \nShard ) Each Shard holds some pieces \nof data.

Major) \n\nTranscript (Name, Course, Grade) \n\nTeacher (Course Professor) \n\nThese decomposition are bad for the following reasons : \n\n(i)\" Redundancy and update anomaly, because the data for the attributes phone no. and major \n\nare repeated. \n\n(ii) Loss of information, because we lose the fact that a student has a given grade in a particular \n\ncourse. \n\nTerms used in Normalization \n\n1.  Determinant \n\nAttribute X is defined as determinant if it uniquely defines the attribute value Y in an entity. \nXY means X decides Y \nHere, X is a determinant and Y is dependent \nExample : Result_Details \nHere, marks attribute decides Grade attribute. \nMarksGrade \nNote : Marks may not be key attribute \n\n2.

Reflexivity: If Y is a subset of X, then X→Y holds by reflexivity rule \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → name is valid. \n\n2.  Augmentation: If X → Y is a valid dependency, then XZ → YZ is also valid by the \n\naugmentation rule. \n\nExample, {roll_no, name} → dept_building is valid, hence {roll_no, name, dept_name} → \n\n{dept_building, dept_name} is also valid. \n\n3.  Transitivity: If X → Y and Y → Z are both valid dependencies, then X→Z is also valid by the \n\nTransitivity rule. \n\nExample, roll_no → dept_name & dept_name → dept_building, then roll_no → dept_building is \n\nalso valid. \n\nTypes of Functional Dependency \n\n1.

This is not possible because SSN \n\nis a primary key. \n\nb)  Modification anomaly \n\nIf we change value of manager of department of 5, we must update all those tuples of employees \nwho work in that department, else inconsistency occurs. \n\nc)  Deletion anomaly \n\nTrying to delete employee tuple where only one record is left out, the information about that \ndepartment is lost from the data base. \n\n• Guideline \n\nDesign the base relation schemas so that no insertion, deletion or modification anomalies are \npresent in the relations. \n\n3. Reducing Null values in tuples \nRelations should have as few NULL values as possible because \n\n•  Wastage of memory at the storage level \n•  Difficult with aggregation functions like count, avg. \n•  Difficult with join operations because the results will be unpredictable. \n\n4.
