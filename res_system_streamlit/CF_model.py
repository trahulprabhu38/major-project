# Collaborative Filtering Implementation
# 
# This file has been superseded by the new implementation.
# Please see:
#   - modules/collaborative_filtering.py (main CF implementation)
#   - CF_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (usage guide)
#   - COLLABORATIVE_FILTERING.md (detailed documentation)
#
# To use collaborative filtering in the app:
# 1. Run: streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# 2. Enable "Use Collaborative Filtering" checkbox in sidebar
# 3. Adjust CF weight slider as needed (default: 0.7)
#
# The new CF system:
# - Clusters students with similar skill gaps
# - Recommends resources based on ratings from similar students
# - Combines CF with content-based filtering (hybrid approach)
# - Shows CF-specific information on resource cards
